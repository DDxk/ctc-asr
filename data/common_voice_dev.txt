common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-dev/sample-001185.wav vibrations of peace throughout the tent
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-dev/sample-001186.wav the time must have been somewhere around six oclock

common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-dev/sample-001206.wav oxygen is important for us but some bacteria dont need it at all
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-dev/sample-001213.wav so usually a keypress instead of a click is used

common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-dev/sample-001215.wav if you can concentrate always on the present youll be a happy man
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-dev/sample-001218.wav but as he saw them lying there on the ground another phrase came to his mind
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-dev/sample-001219.wav what a terrible thing to say
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-dev/sample-001221.wav but now the sounds inside had stopped
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-dev/sample-001222.wav he moved about invisible but everyone could hear him
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-dev/sample-001225.wav thats the way it always is said the old man
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-dev/sample-001227.wav i think its about bird hunting but now i can see how that might be misinterpreted

common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-dev/sample-001302.wav its a code said the boy a bit disappointed
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-dev/sample-001303.wav tell your heart that the fear of suffering is worse than the suffering itself
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-dev/sample-001306.wav they were men of the desert and they were fearful of sorcerers
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-dev/sample-001307.wav id better see what hes up to

common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-dev/sample-001349.wav mostly just the hearts of those who are trying to realize their destinies

common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-dev/sample-001358.wav i am proud of you he said
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-dev/sample-001359.wav it was only when i got this close to it that the strangeness of it was at all evident to me
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-dev/sample-001361.wav and im going to build things
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-dev/sample-001364.wav the thing itself was almost entirely buried in sand
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-dev/sample-001365.wav since the miner had sacrificed everything to his destiny the old man decided to become involved
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-dev/sample-001367.wav the thing itself was almost entirely buried in sand
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-dev/sample-001368.wav drawing from my own experience as a learner of english and german i value engaging activities that involve everyday conversation
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-dev/sample-001381.wav it was just ripe enough to eat
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-dev/sample-001388.wav it is i the boy answered
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-dev/sample-001390.wav theyre not my sheep anymore he said to himself without nostalgia
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-dev/sample-001394.wav he wandered for a while keeping the date palms of the oasis within sight
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-dev/sample-001395.wav and then he perceived it very slowly
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-dev/sample-001396.wav hitting the delete and escape keys did nothing
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-dev/sample-001398.wav how long will it take to get him examined
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-dev/sample-001401.wav they were men of the desert and they were fearful of sorcerers
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-dev/sample-001405.wav i heard a faint movement under my feet
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-dev/sample-001406.wav henderson stood up with a spade in his hand
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-dev/sample-001408.wav only we call them agents
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-dev/sample-001410.wav how they managed to improvise at such short notice shell never know
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-dev/sample-001426.wav the boy was shaking with fear but the alchemist helped him out of the tent
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-dev/sample-001427.wav it looked like a rusty gas float
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-dev/sample-001433.wav lets go and have some lunch said the crystal merchant
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-dev/sample-001437.wav the shop is exactly the size i always wanted it to be

common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-dev/sample-001450.wav i heard a peculiar humming sound from the pit
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-dev/sample-001453.wav that sounds like their problem
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-dev/sample-001455.wav and so do i
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-dev/sample-001456.wav the scale model of the architects plans sat at the center of the conference room

common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-dev/sample-001461.wav this samantha tommy movement costs you a fortune
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-dev/sample-001464.wav its a code said the boy a bit disappointed

common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-dev/sample-001479.wav it looked like a rusty gas float
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-dev/sample-001480.wav something inside the cylinder was unscrewing the top
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-dev/sample-001484.wav then a man approached
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-dev/sample-001488.wav but where are the houses
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-dev/sample-001489.wav isnt it just beautiful
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-dev/sample-001492.wav it rattled menacingly
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-dev/sample-001493.wav the boy wanted to take her hand
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-dev/sample-001499.wav you didnt have to do any cleaning he said

common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-dev/sample-001515.wav he picked up the two stones and put them back in his pouch
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-dev/sample-001519.wav i was scared but wasted no time in going out and crossing the bridge to the sand pits
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-dev/sample-001520.wav the caterpillar responded with a nod
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-dev/sample-001529.wav i want to do what i want to do
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-dev/sample-001537.wav i dont even know who im talking to any more
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-dev/sample-001549.wav and he looked out over the desert that had brought him to the woman he loved

common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-dev/sample-001554.wav whatever the thing observed one could find a connection with his experience of the moment
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-dev/sample-001556.wav everyone seemed very excited

common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-dev/sample-001561.wav but he didnt need to worry about that right now
