/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/dev-clean/6319/57405/6319-57405-0001.wav after jupiter had bound prometheus on mount caucasus and had sent diseases and cares into the world men became very very wicked
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/dev-clean/6319/57405/6319-57405-0002.wav these men he said to his mighty company are nothing but a source of trouble
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/dev-clean/6319/57405/6319-57405-0003.wav but men kept on fighting and robbing even while the rain was pouring down and the sea was coming up over the land
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/dev-clean/6319/57405/6319-57405-0004.wav no one but deucalion the son of prometheus was ready for such a storm
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/dev-clean/6319/57405/6319-57405-0005.wav the day is coming said prometheus when jupiter will send a flood to destroy mankind from the earth
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/dev-clean/6319/57405/6319-57405-0006.wav but deucalion and pyrrha were very sad for they knew that they were the only persons who were left alive in all the land
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/dev-clean/6319/57405/6319-57405-0007.wav is there anything that you wish he asked
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/dev-clean/6319/57405/6319-57405-0008.wav we should like above all things said deucalion to see this land full of people once more for without neighbors and friends the world is a very lonely place indeed
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/dev-clean/6319/57405/6319-57405-0009.wav go on down the mountain said mercury and as you go cast the bones of your mother over your shoulders behind you and with these words he leaped into the air and was seen no more
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/dev-clean/6319/57405/6319-57405-0010.wav what did he mean asked pyrrha
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/dev-clean/6319/57405/6319-57405-0011.wav surely i do not know said deucalion
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/dev-clean/6319/57405/6319-57405-0012.wav when at last they reached the plain they found themselves at the head of a noble company of human beings all eager to serve them
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/dev-clean/6319/275224/6319-275224-0000.wav what a fuss is made about you my dear little friends
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/dev-clean/6319/275224/6319-275224-0001.wav you surely cannot suppose that in a natural state you would be forced to climb regularly up one tall bare stick such as i see you upon now
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/dev-clean/6319/275224/6319-275224-0002.wav your cousin the wild convolvulus whom i left in the fields this morning does no such thing i assure you
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/dev-clean/6319/275224/6319-275224-0003.wav my young plants require heat or they would not live and the pots we are kept in protect us from those cruel wire worms who delight to destroy our roots
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/dev-clean/6319/275224/6319-275224-0004.wav why not allow your silver tufts to luxuriate in a natural manner
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/dev-clean/6319/275224/6319-275224-0005.wav still the rose tree stood out that there must be some great advantages in a gardeners care for she could not pretend to be ignorant of her own superiority to all her wild relations in the woods
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/dev-clean/6319/275224/6319-275224-0006.wav then the wind took another frolic round the garden and made up to the large white lily into whose refined ear he whispered a doubt as to the necessity or advantage of her thick powerful stem being propped up against a stupid ugly stick
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/dev-clean/6319/275224/6319-275224-0007.wav he really grieved to see it
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/dev-clean/6319/275224/6319-275224-0008.wav did that lovely creature suppose that nature who had done so much for her that the fame of her beauty extended throughout the world had yet left her so weak and feeble that she could not support herself in the position most calculated to give her ease and pleasure
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/dev-clean/6319/275224/6319-275224-0009.wav indeed not a flower escaped his mischievous suggestions
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/dev-clean/6319/275224/6319-275224-0010.wav echoed the flowers tremulously as with a sort of fearful pleasure they awaited his approach
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/dev-clean/6319/275224/6319-275224-0011.wav making a sort of eddying circuit round the garden he knocked over the convolvulus pole tore the strips from the stick that held up the white lily loosed all the carnation flowers from their fastenings broke the rose tree down and levelled the sweet peas to the ground
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/dev-clean/6319/275224/6319-275224-0012.wav meanwhile how fared it with the flowers
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/dev-clean/6319/275224/6319-275224-0013.wav oh that she were once more climbing up the friendly fir pole
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/dev-clean/6319/275224/6319-275224-0014.wav the honeysuckle escaped no better and the carnation was ready to die of vexation at finding that her coveted freedom had levelled her to the dirt
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/dev-clean/6319/275224/6319-275224-0015.wav before the day closed the gardener came whistling from his farm work to look over his pretty charges
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/dev-clean/6319/275224/6319-275224-0016.wav but for the sight that awaited him he was not prepared at all
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/dev-clean/6319/275224/6319-275224-0017.wav weeds meanwhile sprang up and a dreary confusion reigned in the once orderly and brilliant little garden
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/dev-clean/6319/275224/6319-275224-0018.wav the mistress had returned and the young lady was with her and hurried at once to her favourite garden
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/dev-clean/6319/275224/6319-275224-0019.wav in this position she remained until a gentle hand was laid upon her shoulder
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/dev-clean/6319/275224/6319-275224-0020.wav i am not thinking about the garden mamma replied the young girl without lifting up her face we can plant new flowers and tie up even some of these afresh
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/dev-clean/6319/64726/6319-64726-0000.wav when at last the queen gave birth to a daughter the king was so overjoyed that he gave a great christening feast the like of which had never before been known
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/dev-clean/6319/64726/6319-64726-0001.wav one of the young fairies overhearing her and fancying she might work some mischief to the little baby went and hid herself behind the hangings in the hall so as to be able to have the last word and undo any harm the old fairy might wish to work
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/dev-clean/6319/64726/6319-64726-0002.wav the turn of the old fairy had now come and she declared while her head shook with malice that the princess should pierce her hand with a spindle and die of the wound
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/dev-clean/6319/64726/6319-64726-0003.wav it is true i cannot entirely undo what my elder has done
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/dev-clean/6319/64726/6319-64726-0004.wav now fifteen years after the princess was born she was with the king and queen at one of their castles and as she was running about by herself she came to a little chamber at the top of a tower and there sat an honest old woman spinning for she had never heard of the kings edict
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/dev-clean/6319/64726/6319-64726-0005.wav she had no sooner taken up the spindle than being hasty and careless she pierced her hand with the point of it and fainted away
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/dev-clean/6319/64726/6319-64726-0006.wav he knew that she would not awake for a hundred years
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/dev-clean/6319/64726/6319-64726-0007.wav one said it was an enchanted castle another that witches lived there but most believed that it was occupied by a great ogre which carried thither all the children he could catch and ate them up one at a time for nobody could get at him through the wood
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/dev-clean/6319/64726/6319-64726-0008.wav the young prince at these words felt himself on fire
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/dev-clean/6319/64726/6319-64726-0009.wav scarcely had he come to the wood when all the trees and thorns which had made such an impenetrable thicket opened on one side and the other to offer him a path
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/dev-clean/6319/64726/6319-64726-0010.wav he entered a large forecourt and stood still with amazement and awe
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/dev-clean/6319/64726/6319-64726-0011.wav but the faces of the men were rosy and the goblets by them had a few drops of wine left
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/dev-clean/6319/64726/6319-64726-0012.wav he entered the guard room there the guards stood drawn up in line with carbines at their shoulders but they were sound asleep
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/dev-clean/6319/64726/6319-64726-0013.wav he passed through one apartment after another where were ladies and gentlemen asleep in their chairs or standing
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/dev-clean/6319/64726/6319-64726-0014.wav i have waited long for you

/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/dev-clean/6319/64726/6319-64726-0016.wav meanwhile all the rest of the people in the castle had been wakened at the same moment as the princess and they were now extremely hungry
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/dev-clean/6319/64726/6319-64726-0017.wav the lady in waiting became very impatient and at length announced to the princess that they all waited for her
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/dev-clean/6319/64726/6319-64726-0018.wav then the prince took the princess by the hand she was dressed in great splendour but he did not hint that she looked as he had seen pictures of his great grandmother look he thought her all the more charming for that
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/dev-clean/6319/64726/6319-64726-0019.wav the violins and haut boys played old but excellent pieces of music and after supper to lose no time the grand almoner married the royal lovers in the chapel of the castle
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/dev-clean/6319/64726/6319-64726-0020.wav he turned to show them the castle but behold

/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/dev-clean/6241/61946/6241-61946-0003.wav geographers have divided it into four parts and we had to cross the southwest quarter which in the vernacular is called sudvestr fjordungr
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/dev-clean/6241/61946/6241-61946-0004.wav we took our way through poor and sparse meadows which made a desperate effort every year to show a little green
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/dev-clean/6241/61946/6241-61946-0005.wav they very rarely succeed in a good show of yellow

/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/dev-clean/6241/61946/6241-61946-0011.wav here and there could be seen an isolated farm some solitary bur or icelandic house built of wood earth fragments of lava looking like beggars on the highway of life
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/dev-clean/6241/61946/6241-61946-0012.wav a few stray cows and sheep were only seen occasionally
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/dev-clean/6241/61946/6241-61946-0013.wav little did i expect however the spectacle which awaited us when we reached the peninsula of sneffels where agglomerations of natures ruins form a kind of terrible chaos
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/dev-clean/6241/61946/6241-61946-0014.wav it consists simply of a few houses not what in england or germany we should call a hamlet

/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/dev-clean/6241/61946/6241-61946-0016.wav these sacred edifices are however very much like these people who do without watches and never miss them
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/dev-clean/6241/61946/6241-61946-0017.wav to ride over salt water upon the back of a little horse seemed to me absurd

/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/dev-clean/6241/61946/6241-61946-0020.wav at length the sturdy little pony spreading out his legs in a stiff and ludicrous attitude got from under the professors legs and left him standing with both feet on a separate stone like the colossus of rhodes

/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/dev-clean/6241/66616/6241-66616-0000.wav but this power of discernment was denied them and only in after years with the loved ones of their own firesides close about them was the whole picture revealed
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/dev-clean/6241/66616/6241-66616-0001.wav one dark night at the head of a score of his tribe he fell upon wabigoons camp his object being the abduction of the princess

/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/dev-clean/6241/66616/6241-66616-0006.wav meanwhile two children came to bless the happy union of newsome and his lovely indian wife
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/dev-clean/6241/66616/6241-66616-0007.wav the other was a girl three years younger and newsome insisted that she be called minnetaki
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/dev-clean/6241/66616/6241-66616-0008.wav curiously enough the blood of wabi ran almost pure to his indian forefathers while minnetaki as she became older developed less of the wild beauty of her mother and more of the softer loveliness of the white race her wealth of soft jet black hair and her great dark eyes contrasting with the lighter skin of her fathers blood

/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/dev-clean/6241/66616/6241-66616-0011.wav consequently both mother and father began their education at the post they were sent to the factors school and two winters were passed in port arthur that they might have the advantage of thoroughly equipped schools

/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/dev-clean/8297/275156/8297-275156-0013.wav but it might perhaps be excusable to infer that the marriage had not yet been decided on and that the captains proposals were still waiting for catherines reply

/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/dev-clean/3170/137482/3170-137482-0028.wav delighted with such a fortunate result we lay down again

/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3570/5695/3570-5695-0012.wav it is also noticeable that the serviceability of consumption as a means of repute as well as the insistence on it as an element of decency is at its best in those portions of the community where the human contact of the individual is widest and the mobility of the population is greatest

/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3570/5694/3570-5694-0008.wav the consumption of luxuries in the true sense is a consumption directed to the comfort of the consumer himself and is therefore a mark of the master

/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3570/5694/3570-5694-0010.wav the objection of course presents itself that expenditure on womens dress and household paraphernalia is an obvious exception to this rule but it will appear in the sequel that this exception is much more obvious than substantial
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3570/5694/3570-5694-0011.wav the custom of festive gatherings probably originated in motives of conviviality and religion these motives are also present in the later development but they do not continue to be the sole motives
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3570/5694/3570-5694-0012.wav there is a more or less elaborate system of rank and grades
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3570/5694/3570-5694-0013.wav this differentiation is furthered by the inheritance of wealth and the consequent inheritance of gentility

/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3570/5694/3570-5694-0017.wav the wearing of uniforms or liveries implies a considerable degree of dependence and may even be said to be a mark of servitude real or ostensible

/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3570/5694/3570-5694-0019.wav but the general distinction is not on that account to be overlooked
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3570/5694/3570-5694-0020.wav so those offices which are by right the proper employment of the leisure class are noble such as government fighting hunting the care of arms and accoutrements and the like in short those which may be classed as ostensibly predatory employments
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3570/5694/3570-5694-0021.wav whenever as in these cases the menial service in question has to do directly with the primary leisure employments of fighting and hunting it easily acquires a reflected honorific character
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3570/5694/3570-5694-0022.wav the livery becomes obnoxious to nearly all who are required to wear it

/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3570/5696/3570-5696-0001.wav but the actual course of development has been somewhat different from this ideal scheme leisure held the first place at the start and came to hold a rank very much above wasteful consumption of goods both as a direct exponent of wealth and as an element in the standard of decency during the quasi peaceable culture

/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3570/5696/3570-5696-0006.wav as used in the speech of everyday life the word carries an undertone of deprecation
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3570/5696/3570-5696-0007.wav the use of the word waste as a technical term therefore implies no deprecation of the motives or of the ends sought by the consumer under this canon of conspicuous waste
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3570/5696/3570-5696-0008.wav but it is on other grounds worth noting that the term waste in the language of everyday life implies deprecation of what is characterized as wasteful
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3570/5696/3570-5696-0009.wav in strict accuracy nothing should be included under the head of conspicuous waste but such expenditure as is incurred on the ground of an invidious pecuniary comparison

/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0000.wav the analysis of knowledge will occupy us until the end of the thirteenth lecture and is the most difficult part of our whole enterprise
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0001.wav what is called perception differs from sensation by the fact that the sensational ingredients bring up habitual associates images and expectations of their usual correlates all of which are subjectively indistinguishable from the sensation
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0002.wav whether or not this principle is liable to exceptions everyone would agree that is has a broad measure of truth though the word exactly might seem an overstatement and it might seem more correct to say that ideas approximately represent impressions
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0003.wav and what sort of evidence is logically possible
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0004.wav there is no logical impossibility in the hypothesis that the world sprang into being five minutes ago exactly as it then was with a population that remembered a wholly unreal past
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0005.wav all that i am doing is to use its logical tenability as a help in the analysis of what occurs when we remember
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0006.wav the behaviourist who attempts to make psychology a record of behaviour has to trust his memory in making the record
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0007.wav habit is a concept involving the occurrence of similar events at different times if the behaviourist feels confident that there is such a phenomenon as habit that can only be because he trusts his memory when it assures him that there have been other times
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0008.wav but i do not think such an inference is warranted
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0009.wav our confidence or lack of confidence in the accuracy of a memory image must in fundamental cases be based upon a characteristic of the image itself since we cannot evoke the past bodily and compare it with the present image
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0010.wav we sometimes have images that are by no means peculiarly vague which yet we do not trust for example under the influence of fatigue we may see a friends face vividly and clearly but horribly distorted
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0011.wav some images like some sensations feel very familiar while others feel strange
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0012.wav familiarity is a feeling capable of degrees
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0013.wav in an image of a well known face for example some parts may feel more familiar than others when this happens we have more belief in the accuracy of the familiar parts than in that of the unfamiliar parts
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0014.wav i come now to the other characteristic which memory images must have in order to account for our knowledge of the past
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0015.wav they must have some characteristic which makes us regard them as referring to more or less remote portions of the past
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0016.wav in actual fact there are doubtless various factors that concur in giving us the feeling of greater or less remoteness in some remembered event
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0017.wav there may be a specific feeling which could be called the feeling of pastness especially where immediate memory is concerned
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0018.wav there is of course a difference between knowing the temporal relation of a remembered event to the present and knowing the time order of two remembered events
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0019.wav it would seem that only rather recent events can be placed at all accurately by means of feelings giving their temporal relation to the present but it is clear that such feelings must play an essential part in the process of dating remembered events
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0020.wav if we had retained the subject or act in knowledge the whole problem of memory would have been comparatively simple
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0021.wav remembering has to be a present occurrence in some way resembling or related to what is remembered
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0022.wav some points may be taken as fixed and such as any theory of memory must arrive at
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0023.wav in this case as in most others what may be taken as certain in advance is rather vague
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0024.wav the first of our vague but indubitable data is that there is knowledge of the past
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0025.wav we might provisionally though perhaps not quite correctly define memory as that way of knowing about the past which has no analogue in our knowledge of the future such a definition would at least serve to mark the problem with which we are concerned though some expectations may deserve to rank with memory as regards immediacy
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0026.wav this distinction is vital to the understanding of memory but it is not so easy to carry out in practice as it is to draw in theory
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0027.wav a gramophone by the help of suitable records might relate to us the incidents of its past and people are not so different from gramophones as they like to believe
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0028.wav i can set to work now to remember things i never remembered before such as what i had to eat for breakfast this morning and it can hardly be wholly habit that enables me to do this
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0029.wav the fact that a man can recite a poem does not show that he remembers any previous occasion on which he has recited or read it
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0030.wav semons two books mentioned in an earlier lecture do not touch knowledge memory at all closely
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0031.wav they give laws according to which images of past occurrences come into our minds but do not discuss our belief that these images refer to past occurrences which is what constitutes knowledge memory
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0032.wav it is this that is of interest to theory of knowledge
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0033.wav it is by no means always reliable almost everybody has at some time experienced the well known illusion that all that is happening now happened before at some time
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0034.wav whenever the sense of familiarity occurs without a definite object it leads us to search the environment until we are satisfied that we have found the appropriate object which leads us to the judgment this is familiar
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0035.wav thus no knowledge as to the past is to be derived from the feeling of familiarity alone
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0036.wav a further stage is recognition
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0037.wav recognition in this sense does not necessarily involve more than a habit of association the kind of object we are seeing at the moment is associated with the word cat or with an auditory image of purring or whatever other characteristic we may happen to recognize in the cat of the moment
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0038.wav we are of course in fact able to judge when we recognize an object that we have seen it before but this judgment is something over and above recognition in this first sense and may very probably be impossible to animals that nevertheless have the experience of recognition in this first sense of the word
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0039.wav this knowledge is memory in one sense though in another it is not
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0040.wav there are however several points in which such an account of recognition is inadequate to begin with it might seem at first sight more correct to define recognition as i have seen this before than as this has existed before
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0041.wav the definition of my experience is difficult broadly speaking it is everything that is connected with what i am experiencing now by certain links of which the various forms of memory are among the most important
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0042.wav thus if i recognize a thing the occasion of its previous existence in virtue of which i recognize it forms part of my experience by definition recognition will be one of the marks by which my experience is singled out from the rest of the world
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0043.wav of course the words this has existed before are a very inadequate translation of what actually happens when we form a judgment of recognition but that is unavoidable words are framed to express a level of thought which is by no means primitive and are quite incapable of expressing such an elementary occurrence as recognition
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/237/126133/237-126133-0000.wav here she would stay comforted and soothed among the lovely plants and rich exotics rejoicing the heart of old turner the gardener who since pollys first rapturous entrance had taken her into his good graces for all time
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/237/126133/237-126133-0001.wav every chance she could steal after practice hours were over and after the clamorous demands of the boys upon her time were fully satisfied was seized to fly on the wings of the wind to the flowers
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/237/126133/237-126133-0002.wav then dear said missus whitney you must be kinder to her than ever think what it would be for one of you to be away from home even among friends

/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/237/126133/237-126133-0014.wav asked phronsie in intense interest slipping down out of pollys arms and crowding up close to jaspers side
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/237/126133/237-126133-0015.wav yes all alone by himself asserted jasper vehemently and winking furiously to the others to stop their laughing he did now truly phronsie
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/237/126133/237-126133-0016.wav oh no jasper i must go by my very own self

/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/237/126133/237-126133-0018.wav dont mind it polly whispered jasper twasnt her fault

/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/237/126133/237-126133-0023.wav he cried in high dudgeon just as if he owned the whole of the peppers and could dispose of them all to suit his fancy
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/237/126133/237-126133-0024.wav and the old gentleman was so delighted with his success that he had to burst out into a series of short happy bits of laughter that occupied quite a space of time
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/237/126133/237-126133-0025.wav at last he came out of them and wiped his face vigorously

/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/237/134500/237-134500-0013.wav marie picked cherries and sang softly to herself stripping one glittering branch after another shivering when she caught a shower of raindrops on her neck and hair
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/237/134500/237-134500-0014.wav and emil mowed his way slowly down toward the cherry trees
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/237/134500/237-134500-0015.wav that summer the rains had been so many and opportune that it was almost more than shabata and his man could do to keep up with the corn the orchard was a neglected wilderness

/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/237/134500/237-134500-0018.wav he reached up among the branches and began to pick the sweet insipid fruit long ivory colored berries tipped with faint pink like white coral that fall to the ground unheeded all summer through
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/237/134500/237-134500-0019.wav he dropped a handful into her lap

/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8455/210777/8455-210777-0013.wav jack had been standing in the far corner of the room talking to eva and was now reduced to silence by his praises
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8455/210777/8455-210777-0014.wav sir kennington oval is a very fine player said my wife
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8455/210777/8455-210777-0015.wav i and my wife and son and the two craswellers and three or four others agreed to dine on board the ship on the next
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8455/210777/8455-210777-0016.wav this i felt was paid to me as being president of the republic and i endeavoured to behave myself with such mingled humility and dignity as might befit the occasion but i could not but feel that something was wanting to the simplicity of my ordinary life
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8455/210777/8455-210777-0017.wav my wife on the spur of the moment managed to give the gentlemen a very good dinner
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8455/210777/8455-210777-0018.wav this she said was true hospitality and i am not sure that i did not agree with her
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8455/210777/8455-210777-0019.wav then there were three or four leading men of the community with their wives who were for the most part the fathers and mothers of the young ladies
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8455/210777/8455-210777-0020.wav oh yes said jack and im nowhere
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8455/210777/8455-210777-0021.wav but i mean to have my innings before long
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8455/210777/8455-210777-0022.wav of what missus neverbend had gone through in providing birds beasts and fishes not to talk of tarts and jellies for the dinner of that day no one but myself can have any idea but it must be admitted that she accomplished her task with thorough success
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8455/210777/8455-210777-0023.wav we sat with the officers some little time after dinner and then went ashore
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8455/210777/8455-210777-0024.wav how much of evil of real accomplished evil had there not occurred to me during the last few days
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8455/210777/8455-210777-0025.wav what could i do now but just lay myself down and die
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8455/210777/8455-210777-0026.wav and the death of which i dreamt could not alas
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8455/210777/8455-210777-0027.wav when this captain should have taken himself and his vessel back to england i would retire to a small farm which i possessed at the farthest side of the island and there in seclusion would i end my days
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8455/210777/8455-210777-0028.wav jack would become evas happy husband and would remain amidst the hurried duties of the eager world
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8455/210777/8455-210777-0029.wav thinking of all this i went to sleep
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8455/210777/8455-210777-0030.wav mister neverbend began the captain and i observed that up to that moment he had generally addressed me as president it cannot be denied that we have come here on an unpleasant mission
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8455/210777/8455-210777-0031.wav you have received us with all that courtesy and hospitality for which your character in england stands so high
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8455/210777/8455-210777-0032.wav it is a duty said i
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8455/210777/8455-210777-0033.wav but your power is so superior to any that i can advance as to make us here feel that there is no disgrace in yielding to it
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8455/210777/8455-210777-0034.wav not a doubt but had your force been only double or treble our own i should have found it my duty to struggle with you
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8455/210777/8455-210777-0035.wav that is all quite true mister neverbend said sir ferdinando brown
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8455/210777/8455-210777-0036.wav i can afford to smile because i am absolutely powerless before you but i do not the less feel that in a matter in which the progress of the world is concerned i or rather we have been put down by brute force
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8455/210777/8455-210777-0037.wav you have come to us threatening us with absolute destruction
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8455/210777/8455-210777-0038.wav therefore i feel myself quite able as president of this republic to receive you with a courtesy due to the servants of a friendly ally
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8455/210777/8455-210777-0039.wav i can assure you he has not even allowed me to see the trigger since i have been on board
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8455/210777/8455-210777-0040.wav then said sir ferdinando there is nothing for it but that he must take you with him
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8455/210777/8455-210777-0041.wav there came upon me a sudden shock when i heard these words which exceeded anything which i had yet felt
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8455/210777/8455-210777-0042.wav you hear what sir ferdinando brown has said replied captain battleax
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8455/210777/8455-210777-0043.wav but what is the delicate mission i asked
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8455/210777/8455-210777-0044.wav i was to be taken away and carried to england or elsewhere or drowned upon the voyage it mattered not which
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8455/210777/8455-210777-0045.wav then the republic of britannula was to be declared as non existent and the british flag was to be exalted and a british governor installed in the executive chambers
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8455/210777/8455-210777-0046.wav you may be quite sure its there said captain battleax and that i can so use it as to half obliterate your town within two minutes of my return on board
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8455/210777/8455-210777-0047.wav you propose to kidnap me i said
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8455/210777/8455-210777-0048.wav what would become of your gun were i to kidnap you
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8455/210777/8455-210777-0049.wav lieutenant crosstrees is a very gallant officer
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8455/210777/8455-210777-0050.wav one of us always remains on board while the other is on shore
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8455/210777/8455-210777-0051.wav what world wide iniquity such a speech as that discloses said i still turning myself to the captain for though i would have crushed them both by my words had it been possible my dislike centred itself on sir ferdinando
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8455/210777/8455-210777-0052.wav you will allow me to suggest said he that that is a matter of opinion
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8455/210777/8455-210777-0053.wav were i to comply with your orders without expressing my own opinion i should seem to have done so willingly hereafter
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8455/210777/8455-210777-0054.wav the letter ran as follows
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8455/210777/8455-210777-0055.wav sir i have it in command to inform your excellency that you have been appointed governor of the crown colony which is called britannula
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8455/210777/8455-210777-0056.wav the peculiar circumstances of the colony are within your excellencys knowledge
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8455/210777/8455-210777-0057.wav but in their selection of a constitution the britannulists have unfortunately allowed themselves but one deliberative assembly and hence have sprung their present difficulties
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8455/210777/8455-210777-0058.wav it is founded on the acknowledged weakness of those who survive that period of life at which men cease to work
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8455/210777/8455-210777-0059.wav but it is surmised that you will find difficulties in the way of your entering at once upon your government
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8455/210777/8455-210777-0060.wav the john bright is armed with a weapon of great power against which it is impossible that the people of britannula should prevail
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8455/210777/8455-210777-0061.wav you will carry out with you one hundred men of the north north west birmingham regiment which will probably suffice for your own security as it is thought that if mister neverbend be withdrawn the people will revert easily to their old habits of obedience
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8455/210777/8455-210777-0062.wav when do you intend that the john bright shall start
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8455/210777/8455-210777-0063.wav to day i shouted
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8455/210777/8455-210777-0064.wav and i have no one ready to whom i can give up the archives of the government
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8455/210777/8455-210777-0065.wav i shall be happy to take charge of them said sir ferdinando
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8455/210777/8455-210777-0066.wav they of course must all be altered
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8455/210777/8455-210777-0067.wav or of the habits of our people it is quite impossible
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8455/210777/8455-210777-0068.wav your power is sufficient i said
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8455/210777/8455-210777-0069.wav if you will give us your promise to meet captain battleax here at this time to morrow we will stretch a point and delay the departure of the john bright for twenty four hours
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8455/210777/8455-210777-0070.wav and this plan was adopted too in order to extract from me a promise that i would depart in peace
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1188/133604/1188-133604-0000.wav you will find me continually speaking of four men titian holbein turner and tintoret in almost the same terms
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1188/133604/1188-133604-0001.wav they unite every quality and sometimes you will find me referring to them as colorists sometimes as chiaroscurists
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1188/133604/1188-133604-0002.wav by being studious of color they are studious of division and while the chiaroscurist devotes himself to the representation of degrees of force in one thing unseparated light the colorists have for their function the attainment of beauty by arrangement of the divisions of light
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1188/133604/1188-133604-0003.wav my first and principal reason was that they enforced beyond all resistance on any student who might attempt to copy them this method of laying portions of distinct hue side by side
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1188/133604/1188-133604-0004.wav some of the touches indeed when the tint has been mixed with much water have been laid in little drops or ponds so that the pigment might crystallize hard at the edge
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1188/133604/1188-133604-0005.wav it is the head of a parrot with a little flower in his beak from a picture of carpaccios one of his series of the life of saint george
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1188/133604/1188-133604-0006.wav then he comes to the beak of it
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1188/133604/1188-133604-0007.wav the brown ground beneath is left for the most part one touch of black is put for the hollow two delicate lines of dark gray define the outer curve and one little quivering touch of white draws the inner edge of the mandible
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1188/133604/1188-133604-0008.wav for believe me the final philosophy of art can only ratify their opinion that the beauty of a cock robin is to be red and of a grass plot to be green and the best skill of art is in instantly seizing on the manifold deliciousness of light which you can only seize by precision of instantaneous touch
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1188/133604/1188-133604-0009.wav now you will see in these studies that the moment the white is inclosed properly and harmonized with the other hues it becomes somehow more precious and pearly than the white paper and that i am not afraid to leave a whole field of untreated white paper all round it being sure that even the little diamonds in the round window will tell as jewels if they are gradated justly
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1188/133604/1188-133604-0010.wav but in this vignette copied from turner you have the two principles brought out perfectly
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1188/133604/1188-133604-0011.wav they are beyond all other works that i know existing dependent for their effect on low subdued tones their favorite choice in time of day being either dawn or twilight and even their brightest sunsets produced chiefly out of gray paper
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1188/133604/1188-133604-0012.wav it may be that a great colorist will use his utmost force of color as a singer his full power of voice but loud or low the virtue is in both cases always in refinement never in loudness
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1188/133604/1188-133604-0013.wav it must remember be one or the other
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1188/133604/1188-133604-0014.wav do not therefore think that the gothic school is an easy one
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1188/133604/1188-133604-0015.wav the law of that school is that everything shall be seen clearly or at least only in such mist or faintness as shall be delightful and i have no doubt that the best introduction to it would be the elementary practice of painting every study on a golden ground
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1188/133604/1188-133604-0016.wav this at once compels you to understand that the work is to be imaginative and decorative that it represents beautiful things in the clearest way but not under existing conditions and that in fact you are producing jewelers work rather than pictures
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1188/133604/1188-133604-0017.wav that a style is restrained or severe does not mean that it is also erroneous
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1188/133604/1188-133604-0018.wav in all early gothic art indeed you will find failure of this kind especially distortion and rigidity which are in many respects painfully to be compared with the splendid repose of classic art
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1188/133604/1188-133604-0019.wav the large letter contains indeed entirely feeble and ill drawn figures that is merely childish and failing work of an inferior hand it is not characteristic of gothic or any other school
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1188/133604/1188-133604-0020.wav but observe you can only do this on one condition that of striving also to create in reality the beauty which you seek in imagination
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1188/133604/1188-133604-0021.wav it will be wholly impossible for you to retain the tranquillity of temper and felicity of faith necessary for noble purist painting unless you are actively engaged in promoting the felicity and peace of practical life
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1188/133604/1188-133604-0022.wav you must look at him in the face fight him conquer him with what scathe you may you need not think to keep out of the way of him
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1188/133604/1188-133604-0023.wav the colorist says first of all as my delicious paroquet was ruby so this nasty viper shall be black and then is the question can i round him off even though he is black and make him slimy and yet springy and close down clotted like a pool of black blood on the earth all the same
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1188/133604/1188-133604-0024.wav nothing will be more precious to you i think in the practical study of art than the conviction which will force itself on you more and more every hour of the way all things are bound together little and great in spirit and in matter
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1188/133604/1188-133604-0025.wav you know i have just been telling you how this school of materialism and clay involved itself at last in cloud and fire
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1188/133604/1188-133604-0026.wav here is an equally typical greek school landscape by wilson lost wholly in golden mist the trees so slightly drawn that you dont know if they are trees or towers and no care for color whatever perfectly deceptive and marvelous effect of sunshine through the mist apollo and the python
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1188/133604/1188-133604-0027.wav now here is raphael exactly between the two trees still drawn leaf by leaf wholly formal but beautiful mist coming gradually into the distance
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1188/133604/1188-133604-0028.wav well then last here is turners greek school of the highest class and you define his art absolutely as first the displaying intensely and with the sternest intellect of natural form as it is and then the envelopment of it with cloud and fire
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1188/133604/1188-133604-0029.wav only there are two sorts of cloud and fire

/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1188/133604/1188-133604-0033.wav every plant in the grass is set formally grows perfectly and may be realized completely

/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1188/133604/1188-133604-0037.wav every line in which the master traces it even where seemingly negligent is lovely and set down with a meditative calmness which makes these two etchings capable of being placed beside the most tranquil work of holbein or duerer
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1188/133604/1188-133604-0038.wav but now here is a subject of which you will wonder at first why turner drew it at all
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1188/133604/1188-133604-0039.wav it has no beauty whatsoever no specialty of picturesqueness and all its lines are cramped and poor

/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1995/1837/1995-1837-0007.wav then of a sudden at midday the sun shot out hot and still no breath of air stirred the sky was like blue steel the earth steamed

/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1995/1837/1995-1837-0013.wav then he looked down the lagoon was dry
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1995/1837/1995-1837-0014.wav he stood a moment bewildered then turned and rushed upon the island a great sheet of dazzling sunlight swept the place and beneath lay a mighty mass of olive green thick tall wet and willowy

/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1995/1836/1995-1836-0002.wav why should he not be as other men
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1995/1836/1995-1836-0003.wav she was not herself a notably intelligent woman she greatly admired intelligence or whatever looked to her like intelligence in others
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1995/1836/1995-1836-0004.wav as she awaited her guests she surveyed the table with both satisfaction and disquietude for her social functions were few tonight there were she checked them off on her fingers sir james creighton the rich english manufacturer and lady creighton mister and missus vanderpool mister harry cresswell and his sister john taylor and his sister and mister charles smith whom the evening papers mentioned as likely to be united states senator from new jersey a selection of guests that had been determined unknown to the hostess by the meeting of cotton interests earlier in the day
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1995/1836/1995-1836-0005.wav missus grey had met southerners before but not intimately and she always had in mind vividly their cruelty to poor negroes a subject she made a point of introducing forthwith
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1995/1836/1995-1836-0006.wav she was therefore most agreeably surprised to hear mister cresswell express himself so cordially as approving of negro education
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1995/1836/1995-1836-0007.wav but you believe in some education asked mary taylor
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1995/1836/1995-1836-0008.wav i believe in the training of people to their highest capacity the englishman here heartily seconded him
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1995/1836/1995-1836-0009.wav but cresswell added significantly capacity differs enormously between races
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1995/1836/1995-1836-0010.wav the vanderpools were sure of this and the englishman instancing india became quite eloquent missus grey was mystified but hardly dared admit it the general trend of the conversation seemed to be that most individuals needed to be submitted to the sharpest scrutiny before being allowed much education and as for the lower races it was simply criminal to open such useless opportunities to them
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1995/1836/1995-1836-0011.wav positively heroic added cresswell avoiding his sisters eyes
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1995/1836/1995-1836-0012.wav but were not er exactly welcomed
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1995/1836/1995-1836-0013.wav mary taylor however related the tale of zora to missus greys private ear later
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1995/1836/1995-1836-0014.wav fortunately said mister vanderpool northerners and southerners are arriving at a better mutual understanding on most of these matters
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/961/2961-961-0000.wav socrates begins the timaeus with a summary of the republic

/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/961/2961-961-0002.wav and therefore to you i turn timaeus citizen of locris who are at once a philosopher and a statesman and to you critias whom all athenians know to be similarly accomplished and to hermocrates who is also fitted by nature and education to share in our discourse
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/961/2961-961-0003.wav i will if timaeus approves i approve
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/961/2961-961-0004.wav listen then socrates to a tale of solons who being the friend of dropidas my great grandfather told it to my grandfather critias and he told me
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/961/2961-961-0005.wav some poems of solon were recited by the boys
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/961/2961-961-0006.wav and what was the subject of the poem said the person who made the remark
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/961/2961-961-0007.wav the subject was a very noble one he described the most famous action in which the athenian people were ever engaged
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/961/2961-961-0008.wav but the memory of their exploits has passed away owing to the lapse of time and the extinction of the actors
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/961/2961-961-0009.wav tell us said the other the whole story and where solon heard the story
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/961/2961-961-0010.wav but in egypt the traditions of our own and other lands are by us registered for ever in our temples
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/961/2961-961-0011.wav the genealogies which you have recited to us out of your own annals solon are a mere childrens story
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/961/2961-961-0012.wav for in the times before the great flood athens was the greatest and best of cities and did the noblest deeds and had the best constitution of any under the face of heaven
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/961/2961-961-0013.wav solon marvelled and desired to be informed of the particulars

/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/961/2961-961-0016.wav i will briefly describe them to you and you shall read the account of them at your leisure in the sacred registers
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/961/2961-961-0017.wav observe again what care the law took in the pursuit of wisdom searching out the deep things of the world and applying them to the use of man
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/961/2961-961-0018.wav the most famous of them all was the overthrow of the island of atlantis
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/961/2961-961-0019.wav for at the peril of her own existence and when the other hellenes had deserted her she repelled the invader and of her own accord gave liberty to all the nations within the pillars
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/961/2961-961-0020.wav this is the explanation of the shallows which are found in that part of the atlantic ocean
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/961/2961-961-0021.wav but i would not speak at the time because i wanted to refresh my memory
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/961/2961-961-0022.wav then now let me explain to you the order of our entertainment first timaeus who is a natural philosopher will speak of the origin of the world going down to the creation of man and then i shall receive the men whom he has created and some of whom will have been educated by you and introduce them to you as the lost athenian citizens of whom the egyptian record spoke
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/960/2961-960-0000.wav he passes abruptly from persons to ideas and numbers and from ideas and numbers to persons from the heavens to man from astronomy to physiology he confuses or rather does not distinguish subject and object first and final causes and is dreaming of geometrical figures lost in a flux of sense
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/960/2961-960-0001.wav the influence with the timaeus has exercised upon posterity is due partly to a misunderstanding
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/960/2961-960-0002.wav in the supposed depths of this dialogue the neo platonists found hidden meanings and connections with the jewish and christian scriptures and out of them they elicited doctrines quite at variance with the spirit of plato
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/960/2961-960-0003.wav they were absorbed in his theology and were under the dominion of his name while that which was truly great and truly characteristic in him his effort to realize and connect abstractions was not understood by them at all
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/960/2961-960-0004.wav there is no danger of the modern commentators on the timaeus falling into the absurdities of the neo platonists
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/960/2961-960-0005.wav in the present day we are well aware that an ancient philosopher is to be interpreted from himself and by the contemporary history of thought
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/960/2961-960-0006.wav the fancies of the neo platonists are only interesting to us because they exhibit a phase of the human mind which prevailed widely in the first centuries of the christian era and is not wholly extinct in our own day
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/960/2961-960-0007.wav but they have nothing to do with the interpretation of plato and in spirit they are opposed to him
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/960/2961-960-0008.wav we do not know how plato would have arranged his own dialogues or whether the thought of arranging any of them besides the two trilogies which he has expressly connected was ever present to his mind
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/960/2961-960-0009.wav the dialogue is primarily concerned with the animal creation including under this term the heavenly bodies and with man only as one among the animals
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/960/2961-960-0010.wav but he has not as yet defined this intermediate territory which lies somewhere between medicine and mathematics and he would have felt that there was as great an impiety in ranking theories of physics first in the order of knowledge as in placing the body before the soul
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/960/2961-960-0011.wav with heracleitus he acknowledges the perpetual flux like anaxagoras he asserts the predominance of mind although admitting an element of necessity which reason is incapable of subduing like the pythagoreans he supposes the mystery of the world to be contained in number
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/960/2961-960-0012.wav many if not all the elements of the pre socratic philosophy are included in the timaeus
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/960/2961-960-0013.wav it is probable that the relation of the ideas to god or of god to the world was differently conceived by him at different times of his life
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/960/2961-960-0014.wav the ideas also remain but they have become types in nature forms of men animals birds fishes
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/960/2961-960-0015.wav the style and plan of the timaeus differ greatly from that of any other of the platonic dialogues
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/960/2961-960-0016.wav but plato has not the same mastery over his instrument which he exhibits in the phaedrus or symposium
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/960/2961-960-0017.wav nothing can exceed the beauty or art of the introduction in which he is using words after his accustomed manner
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/960/2961-960-0018.wav but in the rest of the work the power of language seems to fail him and the dramatic form is wholly given up
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/960/2961-960-0019.wav he could write in one style but not in another and the greek language had not as yet been fashioned by any poet or philosopher to describe physical phenomena
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/960/2961-960-0020.wav and hence we find the same sort of clumsiness in the timaeus of plato which characterizes the philosophical poem of lucretius
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/960/2961-960-0021.wav there is a want of flow and often a defect of rhythm the meaning is sometimes obscure and there is a greater use of apposition and more of repetition than occurs in platos earlier writings
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/960/2961-960-0022.wav plato had not the command of his materials which would have enabled him to produce a perfect work of art
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/260/123440/260-123440-0000.wav and how odd the directions will look

/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/672/122797/672-122797-0009.wav have you not met them anywhere

/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/672/122797/672-122797-0020.wav but the tree did not rejoice at all he grew and grew and was green both winter and summer

/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/672/122797/672-122797-0034.wav a story cried the children drawing a little fat man towards the tree

/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8555/284447/8555-284447-0011.wav suppose its a friend
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8555/284447/8555-284447-0012.wav the captain shook his head
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8555/284447/8555-284447-0013.wav why you said to fetch the first living creature we met and that was this billygoat replied the captain panting hard as he held fast to one of the goats horns
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8555/284447/8555-284447-0014.wav the idea of patching capn bill to a goat was vastly amusing to him and the more he thought of it the more he roared with laughter
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8555/284447/8555-284447-0015.wav they look something alike you know suggested the captain of the guards looking from one to the other doubtfully and theyre nearly the same size if you stand the goat on his hind legs theyve both got the same style of whiskers and theyre both of em obstinate and dangerous so they ought to make a good patch splendid
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8555/284447/8555-284447-0016.wav fine glorious
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8555/284447/8555-284447-0017.wav when this had been accomplished the boolooroo leaned over to try to discover why the frame rolled away seemingly of its own accord and he was the more puzzled because it had never done such a thing before
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8555/284447/8555-284447-0018.wav at once the goat gave a leap escaped from the soldiers and with bowed head rushed upon the boolooroo
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8555/284447/8555-284447-0019.wav before any could stop him he butted his majesty so furiously that the king soared far into the air and tumbled in a heap among the benches where he lay moaning and groaning
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8555/284447/8555-284447-0020.wav the goats warlike spirit was roused by this successful attack
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8555/284447/8555-284447-0021.wav then they sped in great haste for the door and the goat gave a final butt that sent the row of royal ladies all diving into the corridor in another tangle whereupon they shrieked in a manner that terrified everyone within sound of their voices
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8555/284447/8555-284447-0022.wav i had a notion it was you mate as saved me from the knife
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8555/284447/8555-284447-0023.wav i couldnt shiver much bein bound so tight but when im loose i mean to have jus one good shiver to relieve my feelins
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8555/284447/8555-284447-0024.wav come and get the boolooroo she said going toward the benches
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2300/131720/2300-131720-0000.wav the paris plant like that at the crystal palace was a temporary exhibit
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2300/131720/2300-131720-0001.wav the london plant was less temporary but not permanent supplying before it was torn out no fewer than three thousand lamps in hotels churches stores and dwellings in the vicinity of holborn viaduct
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2300/131720/2300-131720-0002.wav there messrs johnson and hammer put into practice many of the ideas now standard in the art and secured much useful data for the work in new york of which the story has just been told
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2300/131720/2300-131720-0003.wav the dynamo electric machine though small was robust for under all the varying speeds of water power and the vicissitudes of the plant to which it belonged it continued in active use until eighteen ninety nine seventeen years
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2300/131720/2300-131720-0004.wav owing to his insistence on low pressure direct current for use in densely populated districts as the only safe and truly universal profitable way of delivering electrical energy to the consumers edison has been frequently spoken of as an opponent of the alternating current
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2300/131720/2300-131720-0005.wav why if we erect a station at the falls it is a great economy to get it up to the city
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2300/131720/2300-131720-0006.wav there seems no good reason for believing that it will change
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2300/131720/2300-131720-0007.wav broad as the prairies and free in thought as the winds that sweep them he is idiosyncratically opposed to loose and wasteful methods to plans of empire that neglect the poor at the gate
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2300/131720/2300-131720-0008.wav everything he has done has been aimed at the conservation of energy the contraction of space the intensification of culture
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2300/131720/2300-131720-0009.wav for some years it was not found feasible to operate motors on alternating current circuits and that reason was often urged against it seriously
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2300/131720/2300-131720-0010.wav it could not be used for electroplating or deposition nor could it charge storage batteries all of which are easily within the ability of the direct current
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2300/131720/2300-131720-0011.wav but when it came to be a question of lighting a scattered suburb a group of dwellings on the outskirts a remote country residence or a farm house the alternating current in all elements save its danger was and is ideal
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2300/131720/2300-131720-0012.wav edison was intolerant of sham and shoddy and nothing would satisfy him that could not stand cross examination by microscope test tube and galvanometer
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2300/131720/2300-131720-0013.wav unless he could secure an engine of smoother running and more exactly governed and regulated than those available for his dynamo and lamp edison realized that he would find it almost impossible to give a steady light
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2300/131720/2300-131720-0014.wav mister edison was a leader far ahead of the time
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2300/131720/2300-131720-0015.wav he obtained the desired speed and load with a friction brake also regulator of speed but waited for an indicator to verify it
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2300/131720/2300-131720-0016.wav then again there was no known way to lubricate an engine for continuous running and mister edison informed me that as a marine engine started before the ship left new york and continued running until it reached its home port so an engine for his purposes must produce light at all times
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2300/131720/2300-131720-0017.wav edison had installed his historic first great central station system in new york on the multiple arc system covered by his feeder and main invention which resulted in a notable saving in the cost of conductors as against a straight two wire system throughout of the tree kind
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2300/131720/2300-131720-0018.wav he soon foresaw that still greater economy would be necessary for commercial success not alone for the larger territory opening but for the compact districts of large cities
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2300/131720/2300-131720-0019.wav the strong position held by the edison system under the strenuous competition that was already springing up was enormously improved by the introduction of the three wire system and it gave an immediate impetus to incandescent lighting
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2300/131720/2300-131720-0020.wav it was specially suited for a trial plant also in the early days when a yield of six or eight lamps to the horse power was considered subject for congratulation
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2300/131720/2300-131720-0021.wav the street conductors were of the overhead pole line construction and were installed by the construction company that had been organized by edison to build and equip central stations
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2300/131720/2300-131720-0022.wav meanwhile he had called upon me to make a report of the three wire system known in england as the hopkinson both doctor john hopkinson and mister edison being independent inventors at practically the same time
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2300/131720/2300-131720-0023.wav i think he was perhaps more appreciative than i was of the discipline of the edison construction department and thought it would be well for us to wait until the morning of the fourth before we started up
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2300/131720/2300-131720-0024.wav but the plant ran and it was the first three wire station in this country
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2300/131720/2300-131720-0025.wav they were later used as reserve machines and finally with the engine retired from service as part of the collection of edisonia but they remain in practically as good condition as when installed in eighteen eighty three
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2300/131720/2300-131720-0026.wav the arc lamp installed outside a customers premises or in a circuit for public street lighting burned so many hours nightly so many nights in the month and was paid for at that rate subject to rebate for hours when the lamp might be out through accident
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2300/131720/2300-131720-0027.wav edison held that the electricity sold must be measured just like gas or water and he proceeded to develop a meter
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2300/131720/2300-131720-0028.wav there was infinite scepticism around him on the subject and while other inventors were also giving the subject their thought the public took it for granted that anything so utterly intangible as electricity that could not be seen or weighed and only gave secondary evidence of itself at the exact point of use could not be brought to accurate registration
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2300/131720/2300-131720-0029.wav hence the edison electrolytic meter is no longer used despite its excellent qualities
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2300/131720/2300-131720-0030.wav the principle employed in the edison electrolytic meter is that which exemplifies the power of electricity to decompose a chemical substance
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2300/131720/2300-131720-0031.wav associated with this simple form of apparatus were various ingenious details and refinements to secure regularity of operation freedom from inaccuracy and immunity from such tampering as would permit theft of current or damage
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2300/131720/2300-131720-0032.wav the standard edison meter practice was to remove the cells once a month to the meter room of the central station company for examination another set being substituted
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2300/131720/2300-131720-0033.wav in december eighteen eighty eight mister w j jenks read an interesting paper before the american institute of electrical engineers on the six years of practical experience had up to that time with the meter then more generally in use than any other
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2300/131720/2300-131720-0034.wav the others having been in operation too short a time to show definite results although they also went quickly to a dividend basis
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2300/131720/2300-131720-0035.wav in this connection it should be mentioned that the association of edison illuminating companies in the same year adopted resolutions unanimously to the effect that the edison meter was accurate and that its use was not expensive for stations above one thousand lights and that the best financial results were invariably secured in a station selling current by meter
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2300/131720/2300-131720-0036.wav the meter continued in general service during eighteen ninety nine and probably up to the close of the century
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2300/131720/2300-131720-0037.wav he weighed and reweighed the meter plates and pursued every line of investigation imaginable but all in vain
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2300/131720/2300-131720-0038.wav he felt he was up against it and that perhaps another kind of a job would suit him better
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2300/131720/2300-131720-0039.wav the problem was solved
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2300/131720/2300-131720-0040.wav we were more interested in the technical condition of the station than in the commercial part
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2300/131720/2300-131720-0041.wav we had meters in which there were two bottles of liquid
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3979/2830-3979-0000.wav we want you to help us publish some leading work of luthers for the general american market will you do it
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3979/2830-3979-0001.wav the condition is that i will be permitted to make luther talk american streamline him so to speak because you will never get people whether in or outside the lutheran church actually to read luther unless we make him talk as he would talk today to americans
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3979/2830-3979-0002.wav let us begin with that his commentary on galatians
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3979/2830-3979-0003.wav the undertaking which seemed so attractive when viewed as a literary task proved a most difficult one and at times became oppressive
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3979/2830-3979-0004.wav it was written in latin
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3979/2830-3979-0005.wav the work had to be condensed
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3979/2830-3979-0006.wav a word should now be said about the origin of luthers commentary on galatians
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3979/2830-3979-0007.wav much later when a friend of his was preparing an edition of all his latin works he remarked to his home circle if i had my way about it they would republish only those of my books which have doctrine my galatians for instance
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3979/2830-3979-0008.wav in other words these three men took down the lectures which luther addressed to his students in the course of galatians and roerer prepared the manuscript for the printer
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3979/2830-3979-0009.wav it presents like no other of luthers writings the central thought of christianity the justification of the sinner for the sake of christs merits alone
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3979/2830-3979-0010.wav but the essence of luthers lectures is there
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3979/2830-3979-0011.wav the lord who has given us power to teach and to hear let him also give us the power to serve and to do luke two

/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0000.wav in every way they sought to undermine the authority of saint paul
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0001.wav they said to the galatians you have no right to think highly of paul
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0002.wav he was the last to turn to christ
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0003.wav paul came later and is beneath us
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0004.wav indeed he persecuted the church of christ for a long time
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0005.wav do you suppose that god for the sake of a few lutheran heretics would disown his entire church

/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0007.wav as the ambassador of a government is honored for his office and not for his private person so the minister of christ should exalt his office in order to gain authority among men
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0008.wav paul takes pride in his ministry not to his own praise but to the praise of god

/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0012.wav the most they could claim is that they were sent by others
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0013.wav he mentions the apostles first because they were appointed directly by god
