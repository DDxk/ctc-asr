libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0024.wav the first of our vague but indubitable data is that there is knowledge of the past

libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/5683/32866/5683-32866-0030.wav a little bit of plaster tumbled down the chimney and startled me confoundedly
libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1188/133604/1188-133604-0000.wav you will find me continually speaking of four men titian holbein turner and tintoret in almost the same terms
libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1188/133604/1188-133604-0001.wav they unite every quality and sometimes you will find me referring to them as colorists sometimes as chiaroscurists
libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1188/133604/1188-133604-0002.wav by being studious of color they are studious of division and while the chiaroscurist devotes himself to the representation of degrees of force in one thing unseparated light the colorists have for their function the attainment of beauty by arrangement of the divisions of light
libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1188/133604/1188-133604-0003.wav my first and principal reason was that they enforced beyond all resistance on any student who might attempt to copy them this method of laying portions of distinct hue side by side
libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1188/133604/1188-133604-0004.wav some of the touches indeed when the tint has been mixed with much water have been laid in little drops or ponds so that the pigment might crystallize hard at the edge
libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1188/133604/1188-133604-0005.wav it is the head of a parrot with a little flower in his beak from a picture of carpaccios one of his series of the life of saint george
libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1188/133604/1188-133604-0006.wav then he comes to the beak of it
libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1188/133604/1188-133604-0007.wav the brown ground beneath is left for the most part one touch of black is put for the hollow two delicate lines of dark gray define the outer curve and one little quivering touch of white draws the inner edge of the mandible
libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1188/133604/1188-133604-0008.wav for believe me the final philosophy of art can only ratify their opinion that the beauty of a cock robin is to be red and of a grass plot to be green and the best skill of art is in instantly seizing on the manifold deliciousness of light which you can only seize by precision of instantaneous touch
libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1188/133604/1188-133604-0009.wav now you will see in these studies that the moment the white is inclosed properly and harmonized with the other hues it becomes somehow more precious and pearly than the white paper and that i am not afraid to leave a whole field of untreated white paper all round it being sure that even the little diamonds in the round window will tell as jewels if they are gradated justly
libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1188/133604/1188-133604-0010.wav but in this vignette copied from turner you have the two principles brought out perfectly
libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1188/133604/1188-133604-0011.wav they are beyond all other works that i know existing dependent for their effect on low subdued tones their favorite choice in time of day being either dawn or twilight and even their brightest sunsets produced chiefly out of gray paper
libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1188/133604/1188-133604-0012.wav it may be that a great colorist will use his utmost force of color as a singer his full power of voice but loud or low the virtue is in both cases always in refinement never in loudness
libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1188/133604/1188-133604-0013.wav it must remember be one or the other
libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1188/133604/1188-133604-0014.wav do not therefore think that the gothic school is an easy one
libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1188/133604/1188-133604-0015.wav the law of that school is that everything shall be seen clearly or at least only in such mist or faintness as shall be delightful and i have no doubt that the best introduction to it would be the elementary practice of painting every study on a golden ground
libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1188/133604/1188-133604-0016.wav this at once compels you to understand that the work is to be imaginative and decorative that it represents beautiful things in the clearest way but not under existing conditions and that in fact you are producing jewelers work rather than pictures
libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1188/133604/1188-133604-0017.wav that a style is restrained or severe does not mean that it is also erroneous
libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1188/133604/1188-133604-0018.wav in all early gothic art indeed you will find failure of this kind especially distortion and rigidity which are in many respects painfully to be compared with the splendid repose of classic art
libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1188/133604/1188-133604-0019.wav the large letter contains indeed entirely feeble and ill drawn figures that is merely childish and failing work of an inferior hand it is not characteristic of gothic or any other school
libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1188/133604/1188-133604-0020.wav but observe you can only do this on one condition that of striving also to create in reality the beauty which you seek in imagination
libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1188/133604/1188-133604-0021.wav it will be wholly impossible for you to retain the tranquillity of temper and felicity of faith necessary for noble purist painting unless you are actively engaged in promoting the felicity and peace of practical life

libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1188/133604/1188-133604-0024.wav nothing will be more precious to you i think in the practical study of art than the conviction which will force itself on you more and more every hour of the way all things are bound together little and great in spirit and in matter
libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1188/133604/1188-133604-0025.wav you know i have just been telling you how this school of materialism and clay involved itself at last in cloud and fire

libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1188/133604/1188-133604-0028.wav well then last here is turners greek school of the highest class and you define his art absolutely as first the displaying intensely and with the sternest intellect of natural form as it is and then the envelopment of it with cloud and fire
libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1188/133604/1188-133604-0029.wav only there are two sorts of cloud and fire

libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0038.wav grace be to you and peace from god the father and from our lord jesus christ
libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0039.wav the terms of grace and peace are common terms with paul and are now pretty well understood
libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0040.wav the greeting of the apostle is refreshing
libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0041.wav grace involves the remission of sins peace and a happy conscience
libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0042.wav the world brands this a pernicious doctrine
libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0043.wav experience proves this

libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0047.wav to do so is to lose god altogether because god becomes intolerable when we seek to measure and to comprehend his infinite majesty

libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0050.wav did not christ himself say i am the way and the truth and the life no man cometh unto the father but by me
libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0051.wav when you argue about the nature of god apart from the question of justification you may be as profound as you like

libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0053.wav at the same time paul confirms our creed that christ is very god
libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0054.wav that christ is very god is apparent in that paul ascribes to him divine powers equally with the father as for instance the power to dispense grace and peace
libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0055.wav to bestow peace and grace lies in the province of god who alone can create these blessings the angels cannot
libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0056.wav otherwise paul should have written grace from god the father and peace from our lord jesus christ
libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0057.wav the arians took christ for a noble and perfect creature superior even to the angels because by him god created heaven and earth

libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0060.wav he never loses sight of the purpose of his epistle
libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0061.wav not gold or silver or paschal lambs or an angel but himself what for
libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0062.wav not for a crown or a kingdom or our goodness but for our sins
libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0063.wav underscore these words for they are full of comfort for sore consciences
libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0064.wav how may we obtain remission of our sins
libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0065.wav paul answers the man who is named jesus christ and the son of god gave himself for our sins
libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0066.wav since christ was given for our sins it stands to reason that they cannot be put away by our own efforts
libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0067.wav this sentence also defines our sins as great so great in fact that the whole world could not make amends for a single sin
libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0068.wav the greatness of the ransom christ the son of god indicates this
libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0069.wav the vicious character of sin is brought out by the words who gave himself for our sins
libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0070.wav but we are careless we make light of sin
libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0071.wav we think that by some little work or merit we can dismiss sin
libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0072.wav this passage then bears out the fact that all men are sold under sin
libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0073.wav this attitude springs from a false conception of sin the conception that sin is a small matter easily taken care of by good works that we must present ourselves unto god with a good conscience that we must feel no sin before we may feel that christ was given for our sins
libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0074.wav this attitude is universal and particularly developed in those who consider themselves better than others
libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0075.wav but the real significance and comfort of the words for our sins is lost upon them
libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0076.wav on the other hand we are not to regard them as so terrible that we must despair
libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3979/2830-3979-0000.wav we want you to help us publish some leading work of luthers for the general american market will you do it
libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3979/2830-3979-0001.wav the condition is that i will be permitted to make luther talk american streamline him so to speak because you will never get people whether in or outside the lutheran church actually to read luther unless we make him talk as he would talk today to americans
libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3979/2830-3979-0002.wav let us begin with that his commentary on galatians
libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3979/2830-3979-0003.wav the undertaking which seemed so attractive when viewed as a literary task proved a most difficult one and at times became oppressive
libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3979/2830-3979-0004.wav it was written in latin
libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3979/2830-3979-0005.wav the work had to be condensed
libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3979/2830-3979-0006.wav a word should now be said about the origin of luthers commentary on galatians
libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3979/2830-3979-0007.wav much later when a friend of his was preparing an edition of all his latin works he remarked to his home circle if i had my way about it they would republish only those of my books which have doctrine my galatians for instance
libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3979/2830-3979-0008.wav in other words these three men took down the lectures which luther addressed to his students in the course of galatians and roerer prepared the manuscript for the printer
libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3979/2830-3979-0009.wav it presents like no other of luthers writings the central thought of christianity the justification of the sinner for the sake of christs merits alone
libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3979/2830-3979-0010.wav but the essence of luthers lectures is there

libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/960/2961-960-0000.wav he passes abruptly from persons to ideas and numbers and from ideas and numbers to persons from the heavens to man from astronomy to physiology he confuses or rather does not distinguish subject and object first and final causes and is dreaming of geometrical figures lost in a flux of sense
libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/960/2961-960-0001.wav the influence with the timaeus has exercised upon posterity is due partly to a misunderstanding
libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/960/2961-960-0002.wav in the supposed depths of this dialogue the neo platonists found hidden meanings and connections with the jewish and christian scriptures and out of them they elicited doctrines quite at variance with the spirit of plato
libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/960/2961-960-0003.wav they were absorbed in his theology and were under the dominion of his name while that which was truly great and truly characteristic in him his effort to realize and connect abstractions was not understood by them at all
libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/960/2961-960-0004.wav there is no danger of the modern commentators on the timaeus falling into the absurdities of the neo platonists
libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/960/2961-960-0005.wav in the present day we are well aware that an ancient philosopher is to be interpreted from himself and by the contemporary history of thought
libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/960/2961-960-0006.wav the fancies of the neo platonists are only interesting to us because they exhibit a phase of the human mind which prevailed widely in the first centuries of the christian era and is not wholly extinct in our own day
libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/960/2961-960-0007.wav but they have nothing to do with the interpretation of plato and in spirit they are opposed to him
libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/960/2961-960-0008.wav we do not know how plato would have arranged his own dialogues or whether the thought of arranging any of them besides the two trilogies which he has expressly connected was ever present to his mind
libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/960/2961-960-0009.wav the dialogue is primarily concerned with the animal creation including under this term the heavenly bodies and with man only as one among the animals
libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/960/2961-960-0010.wav but he has not as yet defined this intermediate territory which lies somewhere between medicine and mathematics and he would have felt that there was as great an impiety in ranking theories of physics first in the order of knowledge as in placing the body before the soul
libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/960/2961-960-0011.wav with heracleitus he acknowledges the perpetual flux like anaxagoras he asserts the predominance of mind although admitting an element of necessity which reason is incapable of subduing like the pythagoreans he supposes the mystery of the world to be contained in number
libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/960/2961-960-0012.wav many if not all the elements of the pre socratic philosophy are included in the timaeus
libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/960/2961-960-0013.wav it is probable that the relation of the ideas to god or of god to the world was differently conceived by him at different times of his life
libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/960/2961-960-0014.wav the ideas also remain but they have become types in nature forms of men animals birds fishes
libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/960/2961-960-0015.wav the style and plan of the timaeus differ greatly from that of any other of the platonic dialogues
libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/960/2961-960-0016.wav but plato has not the same mastery over his instrument which he exhibits in the phaedrus or symposium
libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/960/2961-960-0017.wav nothing can exceed the beauty or art of the introduction in which he is using words after his accustomed manner
libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/960/2961-960-0018.wav but in the rest of the work the power of language seems to fail him and the dramatic form is wholly given up
libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/960/2961-960-0019.wav he could write in one style but not in another and the greek language had not as yet been fashioned by any poet or philosopher to describe physical phenomena

common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000404.wav he needed someone to talk to so as to avoid thinking about the possibility of war

common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000411.wav whenever he saw the sea or a fire he fell silent impressed by their elemental force
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000414.wav i myself heard nothing of that

common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000421.wav it seemed as if what the old king had called beginners luck were no longer functioning
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000459.wav it was however still so hot from its flight through the air
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000446.wav and in that way the months passed
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000471.wav this is christmas eve
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000476.wav i thought about whether we should find coins and models in it and so on
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000500.wav listen dont believe what he says
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000493.wav then he realized that he had been distracted for a few moments looking at the sword
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000467.wav this is the first phase of the job he said
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000513.wav the stranger seemed satisfied with the answer
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000470.wav you certainly delivered the goods
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000504.wav she used her microscope to inspect it

common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000510.wav it was glaringly hot not a cloud in the sky nor a breath of wind
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000531.wav she placed the glass carefully on the edge of the table
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000514.wav hell be ready on time
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000532.wav because you will never again be able to keep it quiet
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000528.wav he instead offers an alternate explanation that relates to site scalability issues
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000545.wav what do you mean by that
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000499.wav its going to take a while the boy said

common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000530.wav my wife pointed out to me the brightness of the red green and yellow signal lights
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000516.wav i want to tell you a story about dreams said the alchemist

common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000593.wav he had tried in vain to establish a relationship with an alchemist
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000614.wav i want to see him do it said the chief
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000609.wav but id like to see the castles in the towns where they live the boy explained

common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000617.wav but the boy was too frightened to listen to words of wisdom
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000607.wav i had the everyone has gary buseys teeth dream again
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000616.wav so how will we name all these hurricanes

common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000641.wav i thought about the difficulties in translation that might arise
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000631.wav he became friendly with the camel driver who traveled alongside him
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000646.wav he had always believed that the sheep were able to understand what he said
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000663.wav and at that i told him and he took my place
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000629.wav he heard a muffled grating sound and saw the black mark jerk forward an inch or so
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000651.wav it was however still so hot from its flight through the air
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000648.wav i dont want any plastics
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000633.wav thats the man who knows all the secrets of the world she said

common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000643.wav so now i fear nothing because it was those omens that brought you to me
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000655.wav after all what he had always wanted was just that to know new places
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000669.wav it may be the gases of the firing that caused the martians inconvenience
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000698.wav he could sell the stones and buy a return ticket
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000687.wav it looked like a rusty gas float
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000672.wav how do people celebrate good weather over there
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000647.wav two more months passed and the shelf brought many customers into the crystal shop
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000702.wav he thought of the merchants daughter and was sure that she had probably married
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000705.wav today i understand something i didnt see before every blessing ignored becomes a curse
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000708.wav two horsemen waiting ahead of them
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000679.wav hundreds of observers saw the flame that night and the night after

common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000724.wav all i saw was an army said the boy

common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000709.wav but you know that im not going to go to mecca

common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000714.wav now i too will be one of the women who wait

common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000748.wav i would have won the junior olympics if not for those medaling kids
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000753.wav but the boy never took his eye off his new friend
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000755.wav the alchemist turned to the boy
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000758.wav thats an inherent disadvantage
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000775.wav most meteorites are more or less rounded
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000777.wav the area was swirling in dust so intense that it hid the moon from view
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000763.wav i read only what the birds wanted to tell me
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000785.wav why was it that he wanted the boy to serve as his instrument
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000793.wav at that point in their lives everything is clear and everything is possible
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000732.wav advancing slowly they searched among the stones
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000795.wav i have never seen a rothschild before
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000772.wav you cant do that
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000764.wav a practice of infidels he said to himself
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000799.wav it was just that he couldnt grasp what it meant
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000802.wav shes going to lose her mind when she finds out
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000787.wav neither the radar nor the other instruments detected the stealth bomber
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000821.wav but only speak a word and my servant will be healed
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000826.wav i got ways of making them talk
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000843.wav the boy watched the exchange with fascination
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000845.wav he told her about the mornings meeting
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000832.wav ogilvy told him everything that he had seen
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000852.wav then you taught me something of the universal language and the soul of the world

common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000844.wav from the railway station in the distance came the sound of trains ringing and rumbling
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000865.wav but i was also stumbling because i couldnt look away from these things
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000859.wav there was a full moon and the boy told the englishman the story of his life
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000862.wav he got up early with the idea of finding it
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000857.wav vibrations of peace throughout the tent
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000885.wav so what is salem like he asked trying to get some sort of clue
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000889.wav is he really supposed to read that many books on philosophy
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000874.wav mary told me that she got to meet up with you while she was back in san francisco
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000880.wav instead the stranger lowered it slowly until the point touched the boys forehead
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000884.wav and this is for me said the alchemist keeping one of the parts
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000890.wav i get thirty dollars a week
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000909.wav the first rule of dont fight club is lets talk about it

common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000940.wav then he dropped his spade picked up his jacket and came out into the road
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000942.wav raisins are delicious
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000944.wav then she filled her vessel with water and left

common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000951.wav who are you he heard a voice ask him in spanish

common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-001234.wav it seemed such a little thing so bright and small and still

common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-001237.wav he left without saying goodbye to the crystal merchant

common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-001273.wav one can imagine these two covered with sand running up the little street in the bright sunlight
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-001302.wav no doubt the impact had caused a flash of fire

common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-001295.wav it would kill you
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-001306.wav before the boy could reply a butterfly appeared and fluttered between him and the old man
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-001318.wav theres no danger the boy said when they had moved on past the encampment

common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-001336.wav another trick the boy thought

common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-001420.wav but the tradition also says that we should believe the messages of the desert
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-001425.wav they also began to feel that they knew a better way than others had
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-001418.wav will you get out and let me handle this
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-001421.wav it would have been visible to me had i only looked up as it passed

common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-001460.wav he saw the boy appear from the other side of the dunes
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-001417.wav it seemed he had made the long journey for nothing

common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-001525.wav as they began to decorate the hallway a silhouette appeared in the doorway
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-001531.wav this was the strangest of all things that ever came to earth from outer space
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-001517.wav she looks kind of bored
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-001496.wav the boy went to his room and packed his belongings

common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-001571.wav as they sat down at the only table in the place the crystal merchant laughed
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-001532.wav so when i look out over your sands i am also looking at her
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-001537.wav he had suddenly remembered that in tarifa there was an old woman who interpreted dreams

common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-001619.wav the sweet corn tasted better grilled
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-001604.wav so the wind blew with all its strength and the sky was filled with sand
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-001637.wav it must have fallen while i was sitting over there
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-001602.wav we got orders to hold you safely in the branches of this pine tree

common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-001739.wav its too early to tell whether the strategy will pay off
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-001762.wav im going to put her through college
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-001763.wav but in his heart he knew that it did matter

common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-001765.wav the men were terrified at his sorcery
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-001768.wav then came the night of the first falling star
