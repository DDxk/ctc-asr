libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0024.wav the first of our vague but indubitable data is that there is knowledge of the past

libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/5683/32866/5683-32866-0030.wav a little bit of plaster tumbled down the chimney and startled me confoundedly
libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1188/133604/1188-133604-0000.wav you will find me continually speaking of four men titian holbein turner and tintoret in almost the same terms
libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1188/133604/1188-133604-0001.wav they unite every quality and sometimes you will find me referring to them as colorists sometimes as chiaroscurists
libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1188/133604/1188-133604-0002.wav by being studious of color they are studious of division and while the chiaroscurist devotes himself to the representation of degrees of force in one thing unseparated light the colorists have for their function the attainment of beauty by arrangement of the divisions of light
libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1188/133604/1188-133604-0003.wav my first and principal reason was that they enforced beyond all resistance on any student who might attempt to copy them this method of laying portions of distinct hue side by side
libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1188/133604/1188-133604-0004.wav some of the touches indeed when the tint has been mixed with much water have been laid in little drops or ponds so that the pigment might crystallize hard at the edge
libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1188/133604/1188-133604-0005.wav it is the head of a parrot with a little flower in his beak from a picture of carpaccios one of his series of the life of saint george
libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1188/133604/1188-133604-0006.wav then he comes to the beak of it
libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1188/133604/1188-133604-0007.wav the brown ground beneath is left for the most part one touch of black is put for the hollow two delicate lines of dark gray define the outer curve and one little quivering touch of white draws the inner edge of the mandible
libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1188/133604/1188-133604-0008.wav for believe me the final philosophy of art can only ratify their opinion that the beauty of a cock robin is to be red and of a grass plot to be green and the best skill of art is in instantly seizing on the manifold deliciousness of light which you can only seize by precision of instantaneous touch
libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1188/133604/1188-133604-0009.wav now you will see in these studies that the moment the white is inclosed properly and harmonized with the other hues it becomes somehow more precious and pearly than the white paper and that i am not afraid to leave a whole field of untreated white paper all round it being sure that even the little diamonds in the round window will tell as jewels if they are gradated justly
libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1188/133604/1188-133604-0010.wav but in this vignette copied from turner you have the two principles brought out perfectly
libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1188/133604/1188-133604-0011.wav they are beyond all other works that i know existing dependent for their effect on low subdued tones their favorite choice in time of day being either dawn or twilight and even their brightest sunsets produced chiefly out of gray paper
libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1188/133604/1188-133604-0012.wav it may be that a great colorist will use his utmost force of color as a singer his full power of voice but loud or low the virtue is in both cases always in refinement never in loudness
libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1188/133604/1188-133604-0013.wav it must remember be one or the other
libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1188/133604/1188-133604-0014.wav do not therefore think that the gothic school is an easy one
libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1188/133604/1188-133604-0015.wav the law of that school is that everything shall be seen clearly or at least only in such mist or faintness as shall be delightful and i have no doubt that the best introduction to it would be the elementary practice of painting every study on a golden ground
libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1188/133604/1188-133604-0016.wav this at once compels you to understand that the work is to be imaginative and decorative that it represents beautiful things in the clearest way but not under existing conditions and that in fact you are producing jewelers work rather than pictures
libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1188/133604/1188-133604-0017.wav that a style is restrained or severe does not mean that it is also erroneous
libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1188/133604/1188-133604-0018.wav in all early gothic art indeed you will find failure of this kind especially distortion and rigidity which are in many respects painfully to be compared with the splendid repose of classic art
libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1188/133604/1188-133604-0019.wav the large letter contains indeed entirely feeble and ill drawn figures that is merely childish and failing work of an inferior hand it is not characteristic of gothic or any other school
libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1188/133604/1188-133604-0020.wav but observe you can only do this on one condition that of striving also to create in reality the beauty which you seek in imagination
libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1188/133604/1188-133604-0021.wav it will be wholly impossible for you to retain the tranquillity of temper and felicity of faith necessary for noble purist painting unless you are actively engaged in promoting the felicity and peace of practical life

libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1188/133604/1188-133604-0024.wav nothing will be more precious to you i think in the practical study of art than the conviction which will force itself on you more and more every hour of the way all things are bound together little and great in spirit and in matter
libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1188/133604/1188-133604-0025.wav you know i have just been telling you how this school of materialism and clay involved itself at last in cloud and fire

libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1188/133604/1188-133604-0028.wav well then last here is turners greek school of the highest class and you define his art absolutely as first the displaying intensely and with the sternest intellect of natural form as it is and then the envelopment of it with cloud and fire
libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1188/133604/1188-133604-0029.wav only there are two sorts of cloud and fire

libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0038.wav grace be to you and peace from god the father and from our lord jesus christ
libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0039.wav the terms of grace and peace are common terms with paul and are now pretty well understood
libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0040.wav the greeting of the apostle is refreshing
libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0041.wav grace involves the remission of sins peace and a happy conscience
libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0042.wav the world brands this a pernicious doctrine
libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0043.wav experience proves this

libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0047.wav to do so is to lose god altogether because god becomes intolerable when we seek to measure and to comprehend his infinite majesty

libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0050.wav did not christ himself say i am the way and the truth and the life no man cometh unto the father but by me
libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0051.wav when you argue about the nature of god apart from the question of justification you may be as profound as you like

libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0053.wav at the same time paul confirms our creed that christ is very god
libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0054.wav that christ is very god is apparent in that paul ascribes to him divine powers equally with the father as for instance the power to dispense grace and peace
libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0055.wav to bestow peace and grace lies in the province of god who alone can create these blessings the angels cannot
libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0056.wav otherwise paul should have written grace from god the father and peace from our lord jesus christ
libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0057.wav the arians took christ for a noble and perfect creature superior even to the angels because by him god created heaven and earth

libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0060.wav he never loses sight of the purpose of his epistle
libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0061.wav not gold or silver or paschal lambs or an angel but himself what for
libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0062.wav not for a crown or a kingdom or our goodness but for our sins
libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0063.wav underscore these words for they are full of comfort for sore consciences
libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0064.wav how may we obtain remission of our sins
libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0065.wav paul answers the man who is named jesus christ and the son of god gave himself for our sins
libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0066.wav since christ was given for our sins it stands to reason that they cannot be put away by our own efforts
libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0067.wav this sentence also defines our sins as great so great in fact that the whole world could not make amends for a single sin
libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0068.wav the greatness of the ransom christ the son of god indicates this
libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0069.wav the vicious character of sin is brought out by the words who gave himself for our sins
libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0070.wav but we are careless we make light of sin
libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0071.wav we think that by some little work or merit we can dismiss sin
libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0072.wav this passage then bears out the fact that all men are sold under sin
libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0073.wav this attitude springs from a false conception of sin the conception that sin is a small matter easily taken care of by good works that we must present ourselves unto god with a good conscience that we must feel no sin before we may feel that christ was given for our sins
libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0074.wav this attitude is universal and particularly developed in those who consider themselves better than others
libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0075.wav but the real significance and comfort of the words for our sins is lost upon them
libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0076.wav on the other hand we are not to regard them as so terrible that we must despair
libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3979/2830-3979-0000.wav we want you to help us publish some leading work of luthers for the general american market will you do it
libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3979/2830-3979-0001.wav the condition is that i will be permitted to make luther talk american streamline him so to speak because you will never get people whether in or outside the lutheran church actually to read luther unless we make him talk as he would talk today to americans
libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3979/2830-3979-0002.wav let us begin with that his commentary on galatians
libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3979/2830-3979-0003.wav the undertaking which seemed so attractive when viewed as a literary task proved a most difficult one and at times became oppressive
libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3979/2830-3979-0004.wav it was written in latin
libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3979/2830-3979-0005.wav the work had to be condensed
libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3979/2830-3979-0006.wav a word should now be said about the origin of luthers commentary on galatians
libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3979/2830-3979-0007.wav much later when a friend of his was preparing an edition of all his latin works he remarked to his home circle if i had my way about it they would republish only those of my books which have doctrine my galatians for instance
libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3979/2830-3979-0008.wav in other words these three men took down the lectures which luther addressed to his students in the course of galatians and roerer prepared the manuscript for the printer
libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3979/2830-3979-0009.wav it presents like no other of luthers writings the central thought of christianity the justification of the sinner for the sake of christs merits alone
libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3979/2830-3979-0010.wav but the essence of luthers lectures is there

libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/960/2961-960-0000.wav he passes abruptly from persons to ideas and numbers and from ideas and numbers to persons from the heavens to man from astronomy to physiology he confuses or rather does not distinguish subject and object first and final causes and is dreaming of geometrical figures lost in a flux of sense
libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/960/2961-960-0001.wav the influence with the timaeus has exercised upon posterity is due partly to a misunderstanding
libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/960/2961-960-0002.wav in the supposed depths of this dialogue the neo platonists found hidden meanings and connections with the jewish and christian scriptures and out of them they elicited doctrines quite at variance with the spirit of plato
libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/960/2961-960-0003.wav they were absorbed in his theology and were under the dominion of his name while that which was truly great and truly characteristic in him his effort to realize and connect abstractions was not understood by them at all
libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/960/2961-960-0004.wav there is no danger of the modern commentators on the timaeus falling into the absurdities of the neo platonists
libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/960/2961-960-0005.wav in the present day we are well aware that an ancient philosopher is to be interpreted from himself and by the contemporary history of thought
libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/960/2961-960-0006.wav the fancies of the neo platonists are only interesting to us because they exhibit a phase of the human mind which prevailed widely in the first centuries of the christian era and is not wholly extinct in our own day
libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/960/2961-960-0007.wav but they have nothing to do with the interpretation of plato and in spirit they are opposed to him
libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/960/2961-960-0008.wav we do not know how plato would have arranged his own dialogues or whether the thought of arranging any of them besides the two trilogies which he has expressly connected was ever present to his mind
libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/960/2961-960-0009.wav the dialogue is primarily concerned with the animal creation including under this term the heavenly bodies and with man only as one among the animals
libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/960/2961-960-0010.wav but he has not as yet defined this intermediate territory which lies somewhere between medicine and mathematics and he would have felt that there was as great an impiety in ranking theories of physics first in the order of knowledge as in placing the body before the soul
libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/960/2961-960-0011.wav with heracleitus he acknowledges the perpetual flux like anaxagoras he asserts the predominance of mind although admitting an element of necessity which reason is incapable of subduing like the pythagoreans he supposes the mystery of the world to be contained in number
libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/960/2961-960-0012.wav many if not all the elements of the pre socratic philosophy are included in the timaeus
libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/960/2961-960-0013.wav it is probable that the relation of the ideas to god or of god to the world was differently conceived by him at different times of his life
libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/960/2961-960-0014.wav the ideas also remain but they have become types in nature forms of men animals birds fishes
libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/960/2961-960-0015.wav the style and plan of the timaeus differ greatly from that of any other of the platonic dialogues
libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/960/2961-960-0016.wav but plato has not the same mastery over his instrument which he exhibits in the phaedrus or symposium
libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/960/2961-960-0017.wav nothing can exceed the beauty or art of the introduction in which he is using words after his accustomed manner
libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/960/2961-960-0018.wav but in the rest of the work the power of language seems to fail him and the dramatic form is wholly given up
libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/960/2961-960-0019.wav he could write in one style but not in another and the greek language had not as yet been fashioned by any poet or philosopher to describe physical phenomena

tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/RobertGupta_2010U_2.wav beautiful music and the source was a man
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/RobertGupta_2010U_3.wav an african american man charming rugged homeless playing a violin that only had two strings
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/RobertGupta_2010U_4.wav and im telling a story that many of you know because steves columns became the basis for a book which was turned into a movie
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/RobertGupta_2010U_5.wav with robert downey jr acting as steve lopez and jamie foxx as nathaniel anthony ayers the juilliard trained double bassist whose promising career was cut short
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/RobertGupta_2010U_6.wav by a tragic affliction with paranoid schizophrenia
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/RobertGupta_2010U_7.wav nathaniel dropped out of juilliard he suffered a complete breakdown and thirty years later he was living homeless on the streets of skid row in downtown los angeles i encourage all of you to read steves book or to watch the movie to understand not only the beautiful bond
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/RobertGupta_2010U_8.wav that formed between these two men but how music helped shape that bond and ultimately was instrumental if youll pardon the pun in helping nathaniel get off the streets
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/RobertGupta_2010U_9.wav i met mister ayers in two thousand eight two years ago at walt disney concert hall he had just heard a performance of beethovens first and fourth symphonies and came backstage and introduced himself he was speaking in a very jovial and gregarious way about yo yo ma and hillary clinton and how the dodgers were never going to make the world series all because of the treacherous first violin passage work in the last movement in beethovens fourth symphony
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/RobertGupta_2010U_10.wav and we got talking about music and i got an email from steve a few days later saying that nathaniel was interested in a violin lesson with me now i should mention that nathaniel refuses treatment
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/RobertGupta_2010U_11.wav because when he was treated it was with shock therapy and thorazine and handcuffs and that scar has stayed with him for his entire life
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/RobertGupta_2010U_12.wav but as a result now he is prone to these schizophrenic episodes the worst of which can manifest themselves as him exploding
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/RobertGupta_2010U_13.wav and then disappearing for days wandering the streets of skid row exposed to its horrors with the torment of his own mind unleashed upon him
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/RobertGupta_2010U_14.wav and nathaniel was in such a state of agitation when we started our first lesson at walt disney concert hall he had a kind of manic glint in his eyes he was lost
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/RobertGupta_2010U_15.wav and he was talking about invisible demons and smoke and how someone was poisoning him in his sleep and i was afraid not for myself but i was afraid that i was going to lose him that he was going to sink into one of his states
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/RobertGupta_2010U_16.wav and that i would ruin his relationship with the violin if i started talking about scales and arpeggios and other exciting forms of didactic violin pedagogy
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/RobertGupta_2010U_18.wav so i just started playing
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/RobertGupta_2010U_19.wav and i played the first movement of the beethoven violin concerto and as i played i understood that there was a profound change occurring in nathaniels eyes
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/RobertGupta_2010U_20.wav it was as if he was in the grip of some invisible pharmaceutical a chemical reaction for which my playing the music
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/RobertGupta_2010U_21.wav was its catalyst and nathaniels manic rage
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/RobertGupta_2010U_22.wav was transformed into understanding a quiet curiosity and grace
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/RobertGupta_2010U_23.wav and in a miracle he lifted his own violin and he started playing by ear certain snippets of violin concertos which he then asked me to complete mendelssohn tchaikovsky sibelius
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/RobertGupta_2010U_24.wav and we started talking about music from bach to beethoven and brahms bruckner all the bs from bartok all the way up to esa pekka salonen and i understood that he not only had an encyclopedic knowledge of music
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/RobertGupta_2010U_25.wav but he related to this music at a personal level he spoke about it with the kind of passion and understanding that i share with my colleagues in the los angeles philharmonic
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/RobertGupta_2010U_26.wav and through playing music and talking about music this man had transformed
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/RobertGupta_2010U_27.wav from the paranoid disturbed man that had just come from walking the streets of downtown los angeles to the charming
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/RobertGupta_2010U_28.wav erudite brilliant juilliard trained musician music is medicine
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/RobertGupta_2010U_29.wav music changes us and for nathaniel music is sanity because music allows him to take his thoughts and delusions and shape them through his imagination and his creativity into reality
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/RobertGupta_2010U_30.wav and that is an escape from his tormented state
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/RobertGupta_2010U_31.wav and i understood that this was the very essence of art this was the very reason why we made music that we take something that exists within all of us at our very fundamental core our emotions
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/RobertGupta_2010U_32.wav and through our artistic lens through our creativity were able to shape those emotions into reality
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/RobertGupta_2010U_33.wav and the reality of that expression reaches all of us and moves us inspires and unites us
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/RobertGupta_2010U_34.wav and for nathaniel music brought him back into a fold of friends
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/RobertGupta_2010U_35.wav the redemptive power of music brought him back into a family of musicians that understood him that recognized his talents and respected him
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/RobertGupta_2010U_36.wav and i will always make music with nathaniel whether were at walt disney concert hall or on skid row because he reminds me why i became a musician thank you

tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/RobertGupta_2010U_40.wav robert gupta
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/RobertGupta_2010U_42.wav i want to play something that i shamelessly stole from cellists so please forgive me
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JaneMcGonigal_2010_1.wav im jane mcgonigal im a game designer ive been making games online now for ten years and my goal for the next decade is to try to make it as easy to save the world in real life as it is to save the world in online games
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JaneMcGonigal_2010_2.wav now i have a plan for this and it entails convincing more people including all of you to spend more time
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JaneMcGonigal_2010_3.wav playing bigger and better games right now we spend three billion hours a week playing online games some of you might be thinking
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JaneMcGonigal_2010_4.wav thats a lot of time to spend playing games maybe too much time considering how many urgent problems we have to solve in the real world but actually according to my research at the institute for the future its actually the opposite is true
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JaneMcGonigal_2010_5.wav three billion hours a week is not nearly enough game play to solve the worlds most urgent problems in fact
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JaneMcGonigal_2010_6.wav i believe that if we want to survive the next century on this planet we need to increase that total dramatically ive calculated the total we need at twenty one billion hours of game play every week
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JaneMcGonigal_2010_7.wav so thats probably a bit of a counterintuitive idea so ill just ill say it again let it sink in if we want to solve problems like hunger poverty climate change global conflict obesity
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JaneMcGonigal_2010_8.wav i believe that we need to aspire to play games online for at least twenty one billion hours a week by the end of the next decade
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JaneMcGonigal_2010_9.wav no im serious
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JaneMcGonigal_2010_10.wav i am here is why this picture pretty much sums up why i think games are so essential to the future survival of the human species truly
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JaneMcGonigal_2010_11.wav this is a portrait by a photographer named phil toledano he wanted to capture the emotion of gaming so he set up a camera in front of gamers while they were playing and this is a classic
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JaneMcGonigal_2010_12.wav gaming emotion now if youre not a gamer you might miss some of the nuance in this photo you probably see the sense of urgency a little bit of
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JaneMcGonigal_2010_13.wav fear but intense concentration deep deep focus on tackling a really difficult problem if you are a gamer you will notice a few nuances here the crinkle of the eyes up and around the mouth is a sign of optimism and the eyebrows up is surprise this is a gamer who is on the verge of something called an epic win now
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JaneMcGonigal_2010_15.wav oh youve heard of that okay good so we have some gamers among us so an epic win is an outcome that is so extraordinarily positive you had no idea it was even possible until you achieved it it was almost beyond the threshold of imagination
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JaneMcGonigal_2010_16.wav and when you get there you are shocked to discover what you are truly capable of thats an epic win
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JaneMcGonigal_2010_17.wav this is a gamer on the verge of an epic win and this is the face that we need to see on millions of problem solvers all over the world as we try to tackle the obstacles of the next century the face of someone
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JaneMcGonigal_2010_18.wav who against all odds is on the verge of an epic win now unfortunately this is more of the face that we see in everyday life now as we try to tackle urgent problems this is what i call the im not good at life face and this is actually me
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JaneMcGonigal_2010_19.wav making it can you see yes good this is actually me making the im not good at life face this is a piece of graffiti in my old neighborhood in berkeley california where i did my phd on why were better in games than we are in real life and this is a problem that a lot of gamers have we feel that we are not as good in reality as we are in games and i dont mean just good as in successful although thats part of it we do achieve more in game worlds but i also mean good as in motivated to do something that matters inspired to collaborate and to cooperate and when were in game worlds
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JaneMcGonigal_2010_20.wav i believe that many of us become the best version of ourselves the most likely to help at a moments notice the most likely to stick with a problem as long at it takes to get up after failure and try again and in real life
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JaneMcGonigal_2010_21.wav when we when we face failure when we confront obstacles we often dont feel that way we feel overcome we feel overwhelmed we feel anxious maybe depressed frustrated or cynical
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JaneMcGonigal_2010_22.wav we never have those feelings when were playing games they just dont exist in games so thats what i wanted to study when i was a graduate student what about games makes it impossible to feel that we cant achieve everything how can we
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JaneMcGonigal_2010_23.wav take those feelings from games and apply them to real world work so i looked at games like world of warcraft which is really the ideal collaborative problem solving environment and i started to notice a few things that make
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JaneMcGonigal_2010_24.wav epic wins so possible in online worlds so the first thing is whenever you show up in one of these online games especially in world of warcraft there are lots and lots of different characters who are willing to trust you with a world saving mission
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JaneMcGonigal_2010_25.wav right away but not just any mission its a mission that is perfectly matched with your current level in the game right so you can do it they never give you a challenge that you cant achieve
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JaneMcGonigal_2010_26.wav but it is on the the verge of what youre capable of so you have to try hard but there is no unemployment in world of warcraft there is no sitting around wringing your hands there is always something specific
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JaneMcGonigal_2010_27.wav and important to be done and there are also tons of collaborators everywhere you go hundreds of thousands of people
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JaneMcGonigal_2010_28.wav ready to work with you to achieve your epic mission its not something that we have in real life that easily this sense that at our fingertips are tons of collaborators and also there is this epic story this inspiring story of why were there
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JaneMcGonigal_2010_29.wav and what were doing and then we get all this positive feedback you guys have heard of leveling up and plus one strength and plus one intelligence we dont get that kind of constant feedback in real life when i get off this stage im not going to have plus one speaking and plus one
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JaneMcGonigal_2010_30.wav crazy idea plus twenty crazy idea i dont get that feedback in real life now the problem with collaborative online environments like world of warcraft
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JaneMcGonigal_2010_31.wav is that its so satisfying to be on the verge of an epic win all the time that we decide to spend all our time in these game worlds its just better than reality so so far collectively all the world of warcraft gamers have spent five point nine three million years solving the virtual problems of azeroth now
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JaneMcGonigal_2010_32.wav thats not necessarily a bad thing it might sound like its a bad thing but to put that in context five point nine three million years ago was when
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JaneMcGonigal_2010_33.wav our earliest primate human ancestors stood up that was the first upright primate okay so when we talk about how much time were currently investing in playing games
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JaneMcGonigal_2010_34.wav the only way it makes sense to even think about it is to talk about time at the magnitude of human evolution which is an extraordinary thing but its also apt because it turns out that by spending all this time playing games we are actually changing
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JaneMcGonigal_2010_35.wav what we are capable of as human beings we are evolving to be a more collaborative and hearty species this is true i believe this so consider this really interesting statistic
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JaneMcGonigal_2010_36.wav it was recently published by a researcher at carnegie mellon university the average young person today in a country with a strong gamer culture
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JaneMcGonigal_2010_37.wav will have spent ten thousand hours playing online games by the age of twenty one now ten thousand hours is a really interesting number for two reasons first of all
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JaneMcGonigal_2010_38.wav for children in the united states ten thousand and eighty hours is the exact amount of time you will spend in school from fifth grade to high school graduation if you have perfect attendance
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JaneMcGonigal_2010_39.wav so we have an entire parallel track of education going on where young people are learning as much about what it takes to be a good gamer as they are learning about everything else in school
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JaneMcGonigal_2010_40.wav and some of you have probably read malcom gladwells new book outliers so you would have heard of his theory of success the ten thousand hour theory of success its based on this great cognitive science research that if we can master
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JaneMcGonigal_2010_41.wav ten thousand hours at effortful study at anything by the age of twenty one we will be virtuosos at it we will be as good at whatever we do as the greatest people in the world and so
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JaneMcGonigal_2010_42.wav now what were looking at is an entire generation of young people who are virtuoso gamers so the big question is
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JaneMcGonigal_2010_43.wav what exactly are gamers getting so good at because if we could figure that out we would have a virtually unprecedented human resource on our hands
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JaneMcGonigal_2010_44.wav this is how many people we now have in the world who spend at least an hour a day playing online games these are our virtuoso gamers five hundred million people who are who are extraordinarily good at something
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JaneMcGonigal_2010_45.wav and in the next decade were going to have another billion gamers who are extraordinarily good
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JaneMcGonigal_2010_46.wav at whatever that is if you dont know it already this is coming the game industry is developing consoles that are low energy and that work with the wireless phone networks instead of broadband internet so that gamers all over the world particularly in india
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JaneMcGonigal_2010_47.wav china brazil can get online they expect one billion more gamers in the next decade it will bring us up to one point five billion gamers
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JaneMcGonigal_2010_48.wav so ive started to think about what these games are making us virtuosos at here are the four things i came up with
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JaneMcGonigal_2010_49.wav the first is urgent optimism okay think of this as extreme self motivation urgent optimism is the desire to act immediately to tackle an obstacle combined with the belief that we have a reasonable hope of success
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JaneMcGonigal_2010_50.wav gamers always believe that an epic win is possible and that it is always worth trying and trying now gamers dont sit around
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JaneMcGonigal_2010_51.wav ok gamers are virtuosos at weaving a tight social fabric there is a lot of interesting research that shows that we like people better after we play a game with them even if theyve beaten us badly
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JaneMcGonigal_2010_52.wav and the reason is it takes a lot of trust to play a game with someone we trust that they will spend their time with us that they will play by the same rules value the same goal theyll stay with the game until its over and so playing a game together actually builds up bonds and trust and cooperation and and we actually build stronger social relationships as a result
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JaneMcGonigal_2010_53.wav blissful productivity i love it you know there is a reason why the average world of warcraft gamer plays for twenty two hours a week kind of a half time job its because we know when were playing a game that were actually happier working hard than we are
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JaneMcGonigal_2010_54.wav relaxing or hanging out we know that we are optimized as human beings to do hard and meaningful work and gamers are willing to work hard all the time if theyre given the right work finally epic meaning
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JaneMcGonigal_2010_55.wav gamers love to be attached to awe inspiring missions to human planetary scale stories so just one bit of trivia that helps put that into perspective so you all know wikipedia
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JaneMcGonigal_2010_56.wav biggest wiki in the world second biggest wiki in the world with nearly eighty thousand articles is the world of warcraft wiki
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JaneMcGonigal_2010_57.wav five million people use it every month they have compiled more information about world of warcraft on the internet than any other topic covered on any other wiki in the world they are building an epic story they are building epic knowledge resource about the world of warcraft okay so these are four superpowers that add up
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JaneMcGonigal_2010_58.wav to one thing gamers are super empowered hopeful individuals
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JaneMcGonigal_2010_59.wav these are people who believe that they are individually capable of changing the world and the only problem is they believe that they are capable of changing virtual worlds and not the real world thats the problem that im trying to solve
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JaneMcGonigal_2010_60.wav there is an economist named edward castronova his work is brilliant he looks at why people are investing so much time and energy and money in online worlds
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JaneMcGonigal_2010_61.wav and he says were witnessing what amounts to no less than a mass exodus to virtual worlds and online game environments and hes an economist so hes rational and he says
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JaneMcGonigal_2010_63.wav not like me im a game designer im exuberant but he says he says
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JaneMcGonigal_2010_64.wav that this makes perfect sense because gamers can achieve more in online worlds than they can in real life they can have stronger social relationships in games than they can have in real life they get better feedback and feel more rewarded in games than they do in real life so he says
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JaneMcGonigal_2010_65.wav for now it makes perfect sense for gamers to spend more time in virtual worlds than the real world now
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JaneMcGonigal_2010_66.wav i also agree that that is rational for now but it is not by any means an optimal situation we have to start making the real world work more like a game so i take my inspiration from something that happened
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JaneMcGonigal_2010_67.wav twenty five hundred years ago these are ancient dice made out of sheeps knuckles right before we had awesome game controlers we had sheeps knuckles and these represent the first game equipment designed by human beings
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JaneMcGonigal_2010_68.wav and if youre familiar with the work of the ancient greek historian herodotus you might know this history which is the history of who invented games and why
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JaneMcGonigal_2010_69.wav herodotus says that games particularly dice games were invented in the kingdom of lydia during a time of famine apparently there was such a severe famine
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JaneMcGonigal_2010_70.wav that the king of lydia decided that they had to do something crazy people were suffering people were fighting it was an extreme situation they needed an extreme solution
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JaneMcGonigal_2010_71.wav so according to herodotus they invented dice games and they set up a kingdom wide policy
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JaneMcGonigal_2010_72.wav on one day everybody would eat and on the next day everybody would play games and they would be so immersed in playing the dice games because games are so engaging and immerse us in such satisfying blissful productivity
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JaneMcGonigal_2010_73.wav they would ignore the fact that they had no food to eat and then on the next day they would play games and on the next day they would eat and according to herodotus
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JaneMcGonigal_2010_74.wav they passed eighteen years this way surviving through a famine by eating on one day and playing games on the next now this is exactly i think how were using games today
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JaneMcGonigal_2010_75.wav were using games to escape real world suffering were using games to get away from everything thats broken in the real environment everything thats not satisfying about real life
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JaneMcGonigal_2010_76.wav and were getting what we need from games but it doesnt have to end there this is really exciting according to herodotus after eighteen years the famine wasnt getting better so the king decided they would play one final dice game
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JaneMcGonigal_2010_77.wav they divided the entire kingdom in half they played one dice game and the winners of that game got to go
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JaneMcGonigal_2010_78.wav on an epic adventure they would leave lydia and they would go out in search of a new place to live leaving behind just enough people
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JaneMcGonigal_2010_79.wav to survive on the resources that were available and hopefully to take the civilization somewhere else where they could thrive now this sounds crazy right
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JaneMcGonigal_2010_80.wav but recently dna evidence has shown that the etruscans who lead to the roman empire actually share the same dna as the ancient lydians and so
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JaneMcGonigal_2010_81.wav recently scientists have suggested that herodotuss crazy story is actually true and geologists have found evidence of a global cooling that lasted for nearly twenty years that could have explained the famine so this crazy story might be true they might have actually
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JaneMcGonigal_2010_82.wav saved their culture by playing games escaping to games for eighteen years and then been so inspired and and knew so much about how to come together with games that they actually saved the entire civilization that way okay we can do that
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JaneMcGonigal_2010_83.wav weve been playing warcraft since nineteen ninety four that was the first real time strategy game from the world of warcraft series that was sixteen years ago
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JaneMcGonigal_2010_84.wav they played dice games for eighteen years weve been playing warcraft for sixteen years i say we are ready for our own epic game now
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JaneMcGonigal_2010_85.wav they had half the civilization go off in search of a new world so thats where i get my twenty one billion hours a week of game play
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JaneMcGonigal_2010_86.wav from lets get half of us to agree to spend an hour a day playing games until we solve real world problems now i know youre asking
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JaneMcGonigal_2010_87.wav how are we going to solve real world problems in games well thats what i have devoted my work to over the past few years at the institute for the future
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JaneMcGonigal_2010_88.wav we have this banner in our offices in palo alto and it expresses our view of how we should try to relate to the future we do not want to try to predict the future what we want to do is make the future
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JaneMcGonigal_2010_89.wav we want to imagine the best case scenario outcome and then we want to empower people to make that outcome a reality we want to imagine epic wins and then give people the means to achieve the epic win
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JaneMcGonigal_2010_90.wav im just going to very briefly show you three games that ive made that are an attempt to give people the means to create epic wins in their own futures
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JaneMcGonigal_2010_91.wav so this is world without oil we made this game in two thousand and seven this is an online game in which you try to survive an oil shortage
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JaneMcGonigal_2010_92.wav the oil shortage is fictional but we put enough online content out there for you to believe that its real and to live your real life as if weve run out of oil so when you come to the game
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JaneMcGonigal_2010_93.wav you sign up you tell us where you live and then we give you real time news videos data feeds that show you exactly how much oil costs whats not available how food supply is being affected how transportation is being affected if schools are closed if their is rioting and you have to figure out how you would live your real life as if this were true and then we ask you to blog about it
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JaneMcGonigal_2010_94.wav to post videos to post photos we piloted this game with seventeen hundred players in two thousand and seven and weve tracked them for the three years since and i can tell you that this is a transformative experience nobody wants to change how they live just because
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JaneMcGonigal_2010_95.wav its good for the world or because we are supposed to but if you immerse them in an epic adventure and tell them
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JaneMcGonigal_2010_96.wav weve run out of oil this is an amazing story and adventure for you to go on challenge yourself to see how you would survive most of our players have kept up the habits that they learned in this game
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JaneMcGonigal_2010_97.wav so for the next world saving game we decided to aim higher bigger problem than just peak oil we did a game called superstruct at the institute for the future
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JaneMcGonigal_2010_98.wav and the premise was a supercomputer has calculated that humans have only twenty three years left on the planet this supercomputer was called the global extinction awareness system of course we asked people to come online almost like a jerry bruckheimer movie
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JaneMcGonigal_2010_99.wav you know jerry bruckheimer movies you form a dream team youve got the astronaut the scientist the ex convict and they all have something to do to save the world
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JaneMcGonigal_2010_101.wav but in our game instead of just having five people on the dream team we said everybody is on the dream team and its your job
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JaneMcGonigal_2010_102.wav to invent the future of energy the future of food the future of health the future of security and the future of the social safety net
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JaneMcGonigal_2010_103.wav we had eight thousand people play that game for eight weeks they came up with five hundred insanely creative solutions that you can go online if you google superstruct and see
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JaneMcGonigal_2010_104.wav so finally the last game were launching it march third this is a game done with the world bank institute if you complete the game you will be
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JaneMcGonigal_2010_105.wav certified by the world bank institute as a social innovator class of two thousand ten working with universities all over sub saharan africa and we are inviting them to learn social innovation skills weve got a graphic novel
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JaneMcGonigal_2010_106.wav weve got leveling up in skills like local insight knowledge networking sustainability vision and resourcefulness i would like to invite all of you to please share this game with young people anywhere in the world particularly in developing areas who might benefit from coming together to try to start to imagine their own social enterprises to save the world
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JaneMcGonigal_2010_107.wav so im going to wrap up now i want to ask a question what do you think happens next weve got all these amazing gamers weve got these games that are kind of pilots of what we might do but none of them have saved the real world yet
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JaneMcGonigal_2010_108.wav well i hope that you will agree with me that gamers are a human resource that we can use
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JaneMcGonigal_2010_109.wav to do real world work that games are a powerful platform for change we have all these amazing superpowers blissful productivity the ability to weave a tight social fabric this feeling of urgent optimism and the desire for epic meaning i really hope that we can come together
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JaneMcGonigal_2010_110.wav to play games that matter to survive on this planet for another century and thats my hope that you will join me in making and playing games like this when i look forward to the next decade i know two things for sure
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JaneMcGonigal_2010_111.wav that we can make any future we can imagine and we can play any games we want so i say let the world changing games begin thank you
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanielKahneman_2010_1.wav everybody talks about happiness these days
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanielKahneman_2010_3.wav i had somebody count the number of books with happiness in the title published in the last five years
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanielKahneman_2010_4.wav and they gave up after about forty and there were many more
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanielKahneman_2010_5.wav there is a huge wave of interest in happiness among researchers there is a lot of happiness coaching everybody would like to make people happier
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanielKahneman_2010_7.wav but in spite of all this flood of work there are several cognitive traps that sort of make it almost impossible to think straight about happiness
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanielKahneman_2010_8.wav and my talk today will be mostly about these cognitive traps this applies to laypeople thinking about their own happiness and it applies to scholars thinking about happiness because it turns out were just as messed up as anybody else is
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanielKahneman_2010_10.wav the first of these trap is a reluctance to admit complexity it turns out that the word happiness is just not a useful word anymore because we apply it to too many different things
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanielKahneman_2010_11.wav i think there is one particular meaning for to which we might restrict it but by and large this is something that well have to give up and well have to adopt the more complicated view of what well being is
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanielKahneman_2010_12.wav the second trap is a confusion between experience and memory basically its between being happy in your life and being happy about your life or happy with your life and those are two very different concepts and theyre both lumped in the notion of happiness
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanielKahneman_2010_13.wav and the third is its the focusing illusion and its the unfortunate fact that we cant think about any circumstance that affects well being without distorting its importance i mean this is a real cognitive trap theres just no way of getting it right
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanielKahneman_2010_15.wav now id like to start with an example of somebody
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanielKahneman_2010_16.wav who had a question and answer session after one of my lectures
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanielKahneman_2010_17.wav reported a story and that was the story he said hed been listening to the symphony
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanielKahneman_2010_18.wav and it was absolutely glorious music and at the very end of the recording there was a dreadful screeching sound and then he added really quite emotionally
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanielKahneman_2010_19.wav it ruined the whole experience
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanielKahneman_2010_20.wav but it hadnt
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanielKahneman_2010_21.wav what it had ruined were the memory of the experience he had had the experience he had had twenty minutes of glorious music they counted for nothing because he was left with a memory the memory was ruined and the memory was all that he had gotten to keep
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanielKahneman_2010_22.wav what this is telling us really is that we might be thinking of ourselves and of other people in terms of two selves there is an experiencing self
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanielKahneman_2010_23.wav who lives in the present
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanielKahneman_2010_24.wav and knows the present is capable of re living the past but basically it has only the present its the experiencing self that the doctor approaches you know when the doctor asks does it hurt now when i touch you here
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanielKahneman_2010_25.wav and then there is a remembering self
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanielKahneman_2010_26.wav and the remembering self is the one that keeps score
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanielKahneman_2010_27.wav and maintains the story of our life and its the one that the doctor
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanielKahneman_2010_28.wav approaches in asking the question
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanielKahneman_2010_30.wav how have you been feeling lately or how was your trip to albania or something like that those are two very different entities the experiencing self
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanielKahneman_2010_31.wav and the and the remembering self and getting confused between them is part of the mess of the notion of happiness
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanielKahneman_2010_33.wav now the remembering self
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanielKahneman_2010_34.wav is a storyteller and that really starts with a basic
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanielKahneman_2010_35.wav response of our memory it starts immediately we dont only tell stories when we set out to tell stories our memory tells us stories that is what we get to keep from our experiences is a story
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanielKahneman_2010_36.wav and let me begin with one example
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanielKahneman_2010_37.wav this is an old study those are actual patients undergoing a painful procedure i wont go into detail its no longer painful these days but it was painful when this when this study was run in the nineteen nineties
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanielKahneman_2010_38.wav they were asked to report on their pain every sixty seconds and here are two patients those are their recordings and you are asked
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanielKahneman_2010_39.wav who of them suffered more and its a very easy question i mean clearly patient b suffered more his colonoscopy was longer and every
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanielKahneman_2010_40.wav minute of pain that patient a had patient b had and more but now there is another question
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanielKahneman_2010_41.wav how much did these patients think they suffered
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanielKahneman_2010_43.wav and here is a surprise
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanielKahneman_2010_44.wav and the surprise is that patient a had a much worse memory of the colonoscopy than patient b the stories of the colonoscopies were different
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanielKahneman_2010_45.wav and because a very critical part of the story is how it ends
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanielKahneman_2010_46.wav and neither of these stories is very inspiring or great but but one of them is distinct but one of them is distinctly worse than the other and the one that is worse is the one where pain was at its peak at the very end
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanielKahneman_2010_47.wav its a bad story how do we know that because we asked these people after their colonoscopy and much later too how bad was the whole thing in total and it was much worse for a than for b in memory
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanielKahneman_2010_48.wav now this is a direct conflict between the experiencing self and the remembering self from the point of view of the experiencing self clearly b had a worse time
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanielKahneman_2010_49.wav now what you could do with patient a and we actually ran clinical experiments and it has been done and it does work you could actually extend the colonoscopy of patient a by just keeping the tube in without jiggling it too much that will
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanielKahneman_2010_50.wav cause the patient to suffer but just a little and much less than before and if you do that for a couple of minutes you have made the experiencing self of patient a worse off
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanielKahneman_2010_51.wav and you have the remembering self of patient a and lot better off because now you have endowed patient a
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanielKahneman_2010_52.wav with a better story about his experience
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanielKahneman_2010_54.wav what defines a story
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanielKahneman_2010_55.wav and that is true of the stories that memory delivers for us and its also true of the stories that we make up what defines a story are changes significant moments and endings endings are very very important and in this case you know the ending dominated
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanielKahneman_2010_57.wav now the experiencing self lives its life
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanielKahneman_2010_58.wav continuously it has moments of experience one after the other and you can ask what happens to these moments and the answer is really straightforward
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanielKahneman_2010_59.wav they are lost forever i mean most of the moments of our life and i calculated you know the psychological present is said to be about three seconds long which means that you know in in a life there are about six hundred million of them in a month there are about six hundred thousand
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanielKahneman_2010_61.wav most of them dont leave a trace most of them are completely ignored by the remembering self
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanielKahneman_2010_62.wav and yet somehow you get the sense that they should count
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanielKahneman_2010_63.wav that what happens during these moments of experience is our life
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanielKahneman_2010_64.wav its the finite resource that were spending while were on this earth
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanielKahneman_2010_65.wav and how to spend it would seem to be relevant but that is not the story that the remembering self keeps for us so we have the
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanielKahneman_2010_66.wav remembering self and the experiencing self and theyre really quite distinct the biggest difference between them is in the handling of time
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanielKahneman_2010_68.wav from the point of view of the experiencing self if you have a vacation and the second week is just as good as the first then
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanielKahneman_2010_69.wav the two week vacation is twice as good as the one week vacation thats not the way it works at all for the remembering self for the remembering self a two week vacation is barely better
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanielKahneman_2010_70.wav than the one week vacation because there are no new memories added you have not changed the story
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanielKahneman_2010_71.wav and in this way time is actually the critical variable that distinguishes a remembering self from an experiencing self time has very little impact on this story
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanielKahneman_2010_73.wav now the remembering self does more than remember and tell stories it is actually the one that makes decisions
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanielKahneman_2010_74.wav because if you have a patient who has had say two colonoscopies with two different surgeons and is deciding which of them to choose then
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanielKahneman_2010_75.wav the one that chooses is the one that has you know the memory that is less bad and thats the the surgeon that will be chosen
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanielKahneman_2010_76.wav the experiencing self has no voice in this choice we actually dont choose between experiences we choose between memories of experiences and even when we think about the future
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanielKahneman_2010_77.wav we dont think of our future normally as experiences we think of our future as anticipated memories
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanielKahneman_2010_78.wav and basically you can look at this you know as a tyranny of the remembering self
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanielKahneman_2010_79.wav and you can think of the remembering self sort of dragging the experiencing self through experiences that the experiencing self doesnt need
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanielKahneman_2010_80.wav i have that sense that when we go on vacations this is very frequently the case that is that its
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanielKahneman_2010_81.wav we we go on vacations to a very large extent in the service of our remembering self
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanielKahneman_2010_83.wav and this is a bit hard to justify i think i mean i
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanielKahneman_2010_84.wav how much do we consume our memories that is one of the explanations that is given for the dominance of the remembering self and
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanielKahneman_2010_85.wav when i think about that i think about a vacation we had in antarctica a few years ago which was clearly the best vacation ive ever had and i think of it relatively often
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanielKahneman_2010_86.wav relative to how much i think of other vacations and
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanielKahneman_2010_87.wav i probably have consumed my memories of that three week trip i would say for about twenty five minutes in the last four years now you know if if i had ever opened the folder with the six hundred pictures in it i would have spent another hour
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanielKahneman_2010_88.wav now that is three weeks and that is at most an hour and a half
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanielKahneman_2010_89.wav there seems to be a discrepancy now i may be a bit extreme you know in how little appetite i have for consuming memories but even if you do more of this
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanielKahneman_2010_90.wav there is a genuine question
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanielKahneman_2010_91.wav why do we put so much weight on memory relative to the weight that we put on experiences so i want you to think about a thought experiment
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanielKahneman_2010_92.wav imagine that for your next vacation you know that at the end of the the vacation all your pictures will be destroyed
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanielKahneman_2010_93.wav and youll get an amnesic drug so that you wont remember anything now would you choose the same vacation
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanielKahneman_2010_94.wav and and if and if you would choose a different vacation
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanielKahneman_2010_95.wav there is a conflict between your two selves and you need to think about how to adjudicate that conflict and its actually not at all obvious because if you think in terms of time
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanielKahneman_2010_96.wav then you get one answer and if you think in terms of memories you might get another answer
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanielKahneman_2010_97.wav why do we pick them the vacations we do is a problem that confronts us you know with a choice between the two selves
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanielKahneman_2010_98.wav now the two selves bring up two notions of happiness there are really two concepts of happiness that we can apply one per self
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanielKahneman_2010_99.wav and so you can ask how happy is the experiencing self and then you would ask how happy are the moments in the experiencing selfs life
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanielKahneman_2010_100.wav and theyre all happiness for moments is a fairly complicated process what are the emotions that can be measured and by the way now we are capable of
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanielKahneman_2010_101.wav getting a pretty good idea of the happiness of the experiencing self over time
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanielKahneman_2010_103.wav if you ask for the happiness of the remembering self its a completely different thing this is not about how happily a person lives it is about how satisfied or pleased the person is when that person thinks about her life
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanielKahneman_2010_104.wav very different notions anyone who doesnt distinguish those notions is going to mess up the study of happiness and i belong to a crowd of students of well being
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanielKahneman_2010_105.wav whove been messing up the study of happiness for a long time in precisely this way the the distinction between the happiness of the experiencing self and the satisfaction of the remembering self has been recognized in recent years
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanielKahneman_2010_106.wav and there are now efforts to measure the two separately the gallup organization has a world poll with more that half a million people have been asked questions about what they think of their life and about
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanielKahneman_2010_107.wav their experiences and there there have been other efforts along those lines so in recent years we have begun to learn about the happiness of the two selves
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanielKahneman_2010_108.wav and the main lesson i think that we have learned is they are really different
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanielKahneman_2010_109.wav you can know how satisfied somebody is with their life and that really doesnt teach you much about how happily theyre living their life
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanielKahneman_2010_110.wav and vice versa you know just to give you a sense of the correlation the correlation is about point five what that means is if you met somebody and you were told oh his father is six feet tall
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanielKahneman_2010_111.wav would how much would you know about his height well you would know something about his height but theres a lot of uncertainty you have that much uncertainty if i tell you that somebody
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanielKahneman_2010_112.wav ranked their life eight on a scale of ten you have a lot of uncertainty about how happy they are with their experiencing self
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanielKahneman_2010_113.wav so the correlation is low we know something about what controls satisfaction of the happiness self we know that money is very important goals are very important we know that happiness is mainly
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanielKahneman_2010_114.wav being satisfied with people that we like
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanielKahneman_2010_115.wav spending time with people that we like there are other pleasures but this is dominant so if you want to maximize the happiness of the two selves you are going to end up doing very different things
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanielKahneman_2010_116.wav the bottom line of what ive said here is that we really should not think of happiness as a substitute for well being it is a completely different notion
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanielKahneman_2010_118.wav now very quickly another reason we cannot think straight about happiness is that
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanielKahneman_2010_120.wav we do not attend the same to the same things when we think about life and we actually live so if you ask the simple question of how happy people are in california
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanielKahneman_2010_121.wav you are not going to get to the correct answer when you ask that question you think people must be happier in california if if say you live in ohio
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanielKahneman_2010_122.wav and what happens is when you think about living in california you are thinking of the contrast between california and other places
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanielKahneman_2010_123.wav and that contrast say is in climate well it turns out that climate is not very important to the experiencing self and is not even very important to the reflective self that decides how happy people are
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanielKahneman_2010_124.wav but now because the reflective self is in charge
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanielKahneman_2010_125.wav you may end up some people may end up moving to california and its sort of interesting to trace what is going to happen to people who move to california in the hope of getting happier
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanielKahneman_2010_126.wav well their experiencing self is not going to get happier we know that
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanielKahneman_2010_128.wav but one thing will happen they will think they are happier
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanielKahneman_2010_129.wav because when they think about it theyll be reminded of how horrible the weather was in ohio
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanielKahneman_2010_130.wav and they will feel they made the right decision it is very difficult to think straight about well being and
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanielKahneman_2010_131.wav i hope i have given you a sense of how difficult it is thank you
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanielKahneman_2010_133.wav thank you ive got a question for you
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanielKahneman_2010_135.wav thank thank you so much now when we were on the phone a few weeks ago
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanielKahneman_2010_136.wav you mentioned to me that there was quite an interesting result came out of that gallup survey
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanielKahneman_2010_137.wav is that is that something you can share since you do have a few moments left now sure
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanielKahneman_2010_138.wav sure i think the most interesting result that we found in the gallup survey is a number which we absolutely did not expect to find we found that with respect to the happiness of the experiencing self
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanielKahneman_2010_140.wav when you know we looked at how at how feelings vary with income
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanielKahneman_2010_141.wav and it turns out that below an income of sixty thousand dollars a year for americans and thats a very large sample of americans like six hundred thousand so its a large representative sample below an income of six hundred thousand dollars a year
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanielKahneman_2010_142.wav six sixty thousand
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanielKahneman_2010_143.wav sixty thousand
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanielKahneman_2010_145.wav sixty thousand sixty thousand dollars a year people are unhappy and they get progressively unhappier the poorer they get above that we get an absolutely flat line i mean ive rarely seen lines so flat
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanielKahneman_2010_146.wav clearly what is happening is money does not buy you experiential happiness but lack of money certainly buys you misery
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanielKahneman_2010_147.wav and we can measure that misery very very clearly in terms of
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanielKahneman_2010_148.wav the other self the remembering self you get a different story the more money you earn the more satisfied you are that does not hold for emotions
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanielKahneman_2010_149.wav but danny the the whole american endeavor is about you know life liberty the pursuit of happiness
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanielKahneman_2010_151.wav if people took seriously that finding i mean it seems to turn upside down everything we believe about
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanielKahneman_2010_152.wav you know for example taxation policy and so forth is is there any chance that politicians that the country generally would take a finding like that seriously and run public policy based on it
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanielKahneman_2010_153.wav you know i think that there is recognition of the role of happiness research in public policy the recognition is going to be slow in the united states no question about that but in the uk it is happening and in other countries it is happening
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanielKahneman_2010_154.wav people are recognizing that they ought to be thinking of policy of happiness when they think of public policy
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanielKahneman_2010_156.wav its going to take a while and its not going to and people are going to debate whether they want to study experience happiness or whether they want to study life evaluation so we need to have that debate fairly soon how to enhance happiness
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanielKahneman_2010_157.wav goes very different ways depending on how you think and whether you think of the remembering self or you think of the experiencing self this is going to influence policy i think in years to come in the united states efforts are being made
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanielKahneman_2010_158.wav to measure the experience happiness of the population this is going to be i think within the next decade or two part of national statistics
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanielKahneman_2010_159.wav well it seems to me this issue will or at least should be
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanielKahneman_2010_160.wav the most interesting policy discussion to track over the next few years thank you so much for inventing behavioral economics
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanielKahneman_2010_161.wav thank you danny kahneman
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/EricMead_2009P_1.wav for some time i have been interested in the placebo effect which might seem like an odd thing for a magician to be interested in unless you think of it in the terms that i do which is something fake
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/EricMead_2009P_2.wav is believed in enough by somebody that it becomes something real in other words sugar pills have a measurable effect in certain kinds of studies the placebo effect just because the person thinks
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/EricMead_2009P_3.wav that whats happening to them is a pharmaceutical or some sort of a for pain management for example if they believe it enough there is a measurable effect in the body called the placebo effect something fake becomes something real because of someones perception of it
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/EricMead_2009P_4.wav in order for us to understand each other i want to start by showing you a rudimentary very simple magic trick and im going to show you how it works this is a trick thats been in every childrens magic book since at least the nineteen fifties i learned it myself from cub scout magic in the nineteen seventies
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/EricMead_2009P_5.wav ill do it for you and then ill explain it and then ill explain why i explained it ok so here is what happens the knife which you can examine my hand which you could examine
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/EricMead_2009P_6.wav im just going to hold the knife in my fist like this ill get my sleeve back and to make sure nothing goes up or down my sleeve im just going to squeeze my wrist right here right
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/EricMead_2009P_7.wav that way you can see that at no time can anything travel as long as im squeezing there nothing can go up or down my sleeve and the object of this is quite simple
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/EricMead_2009P_9.wav im going to open my hand and hopefully if all is well
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/EricMead_2009P_11.wav my pure animal magnetism will hold the knife in fact its held so tightly in place that i can shake it
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/EricMead_2009P_12.wav and the knife does not come off nothing goes up or down my sleeve no trickery and you can examine everything ta da
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/EricMead_2009P_14.wav so this is a trick that i often teach to young children that are interested in magic because you can learn a great deal about deception by studying this very even though its a very simple trick methodologically probably many of you in the room know this trick what happens is this i hold the knife in my hand
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/EricMead_2009P_15.wav i say im going to grab hold of my wrist to make sure nothing goes up or down my sleeve that is a lie the reason im holding onto my wrist is because thats actually the secret
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/EricMead_2009P_16.wav of the illusion in a moment when my hand moves from facing you to being away from you this finger right here my index finger is just going to shift from where it is to a position
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/EricMead_2009P_17.wav pointing out like this
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/EricMead_2009P_18.wav nice one
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/EricMead_2009P_19.wav someone who didnt have a childhood is out there
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/EricMead_2009P_21.wav so it goes like this from here right and as i move around my finger shifts so we could talk about why this is deceptive why you dont notice there are only three fingers down here because the mind and the way it processes information it doesnt count one two three it groups them but thats not really what this is about right and then i open my hand up obviously its clinging there not by animal magnetism but by
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/EricMead_2009P_22.wav chicanery my index finger being there and then when i close my finger same thing as i move back
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/EricMead_2009P_23.wav this motion kind of covers the moving back of my finger i take this hand away you give the knife out there is a trick you can do for your friends and neighbors thanks now
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/EricMead_2009P_25.wav what does that have to do with the placebo effect well
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/EricMead_2009P_27.wav i read a study a year or so ago that really blew my mind wide open im not a doctor or a researcher so this to me was an astonishing thing
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/EricMead_2009P_28.wav turns out that if you administer a placebo in the form of a white pill thats like aspirin shaped its just a round white pill it has some certain measurable effect but if you change the form that you give the placebo in like you make a smaller pill and color it blue and stamp a letter into it it is actually measurably more effective
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/EricMead_2009P_29.wav even though neither one of these things has any pharmaceutical theyre sugar pills but a white pill is not as good as a blue pill what
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/EricMead_2009P_31.wav that really flipped me out turns out though that thats not even where it stops if you have capsules
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/EricMead_2009P_32.wav they are more effective than tablets in any form a colored capsule thats yellow on one end and red on the other is better than a white capsule dosage has something to do with this you know one pill twice a day is not as good at three pills
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/EricMead_2009P_33.wav i dont remember the statistic now sorry but the point is
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/EricMead_2009P_35.wav these dosages have something to do with it and the form has something and if you want the ultimate in placebo youve go to the needle
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/EricMead_2009P_36.wav right a syringe with some inert a couple ccs of some inert something and you inject this into a patient well this is such a powerful image in their mind it its so much stronger than the white pill its a really this graph well ill show it to you some other time when we have slides the point is
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/EricMead_2009P_38.wav the white pill is not as good as the blue pill is not as good as the capsule is not as good as the needle and none of it has any real pharmaceutical quality its only your belief that makes it real
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/EricMead_2009P_39.wav in your body and makes a stronger effect i wanted to see if i could take that idea and apply it to a magic trick and take something that is obviously a fake trick and make it seem real
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/EricMead_2009P_41.wav and we know from that study that when you want reality you go to the needle this is a seven inch hat pin its very very sharp
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/EricMead_2009P_42.wav and im going to just sterilize it a tiny bit ok
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/EricMead_2009P_43.wav this is really my flesh this is not damians special grown flesh thats my skin right there this is not a hollywood special effect im going to pierce my skin and run this needle through to the other side
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/EricMead_2009P_44.wav if youre queasy if you if you faint easily i was doing this for some friends in the hotel room last night and some people that i didnt know and one woman almost passed out so i suggest if you if you get queasy easy that you look away for about the next thirty in fact you know what ill do the first bad part behind it youll get to see you can look away too if youd like to
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/EricMead_2009P_45.wav so here is what happens right here the beginning of my flesh at the lower part of my arm i just make a little pierce
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/EricMead_2009P_46.wav im sorry man am i freaking you out ok and then just through my skin a tiny bit and out the other side like this
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/EricMead_2009P_48.wav now essentially were in the same position we were in with the knife trick
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/EricMead_2009P_50.wav sort of
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/EricMead_2009P_51.wav but you cant count my fingers right now can you so let me show them to you thats one two three four five yes
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/EricMead_2009P_53.wav i know what people think when they see this they go well hes certainly not dumb enough to stab himself through the skin to entertain us for a few minutes
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/EricMead_2009P_55.wav so let me give you a little peek
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/EricMead_2009P_57.wav hows that look out there pretty good
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/EricMead_2009P_59.wav yeah i know
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/EricMead_2009P_61.wav and the people in the back go okay i didnt really see that people in the satellite room are like starting to move in now let me give you good close look at this that really is my skin that is not a hollywood special effect thats my flesh
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/EricMead_2009P_62.wav and i can twist that around im sorry if youre getting queasy look away dont look at the thing
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/EricMead_2009P_63.wav people in the back or people on video years from now watching this will go well yeah that looks kind of neat in
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/EricMead_2009P_64.wav some sort of effect there but if it were real he would be see theres a hole there and a hole there if it were real he would be bleeding
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/EricMead_2009P_65.wav let me work up some blood for you
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/EricMead_2009P_67.wav yes there it is
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/EricMead_2009P_69.wav normally now i would take the needle out i would clean off my arm and i would show you that there are no wounds but i think in this context and with the idea of
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/EricMead_2009P_70.wav taking something fake and making it into something real im just going to leave it there and walk off the stage
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/EricMead_2009P_72.wav i will be seeing you several times over the next few days i hope youre looking forward to that thank you very much
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/TomWujec_2010U_1.wav several years ago here at ted peter skillman introduced a design challenge called the marshmallow challenge and the ideas pretty simple teams of four have to build the tallest free standing structure out of twenty sticks of spaghetti one yard of tape one yard of string and a marshmallow the marshmallow has to be on top and though it seems really simple its actually pretty hard because it forces people to collaborate very quickly
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/TomWujec_2010U_2.wav and so i thought that this was an interesting idea and i incorporated it into a design workshop and it was a huge success and since then ive
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/TomWujec_2010U_3.wav conducted about seventy design workshops across the world with students and designers and architects even the ctos of the fortune fifty and theres something about this exercise that reveals very deep lessons about the nature of collaboration and id like to share some of them with you so
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/TomWujec_2010U_4.wav normally most people begin by orienting themselves to the task they talk about it they figure out what its going to look like they jockey for power then they spend some time planning organizing they sketch in they lay out spaghetti they spend the majority of their time assembling the sticks into ever growing structures and then
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/TomWujec_2010U_5.wav finally just as theyre running out of time someone takes out the marshmallow and then they gingerly put it on top and they stand back
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/TomWujec_2010U_6.wav and ta da
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/TomWujec_2010U_7.wav they admire their work but what really happens most of the time is that the ta da turns into an uh oh because the weight of the marshmallow causes the entire structure to buckle and to collapse so
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/TomWujec_2010U_8.wav there are a number of people who have a lot more uh oh moments than others and among the worst are recent graduates of business school
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/TomWujec_2010U_10.wav they lie they cheat they get distracted and they produce really lame structures and of course there are teams that have a lot more ta da structures and among the best are recent graduates of kindergarten
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/TomWujec_2010U_12.wav and
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/TomWujec_2010U_14.wav its pretty amazing as peter tells us not only do do they produce the tallest structures but theyre the most interesting structures of them all so the question you want to ask is how come
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/TomWujec_2010U_15.wav why what is it about them and peter likes to say that none of this none of the kids spend any time trying to be ceo of spaghetti inc
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/TomWujec_2010U_16.wav right they dont time spend time jockeying for power but theres another reason as well and the reason is that business students are trained to find the single right plan
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/TomWujec_2010U_17.wav right and then they execute on it and then what happens is when they put the marshmallow on the top they run out of time and what happens its a crisis
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/TomWujec_2010U_19.wav sound familiar right ok what kindergarteners do differently is that they start with the marshmallow and they build prototypes successive prototypes
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/TomWujec_2010U_20.wav always keeping the marshmallow on top so they have multiple times to to fix ill built prototypes along the way so designers recognize this type of collaboration
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/TomWujec_2010U_21.wav as the essence of the iterative process and with each version kids get instant feedback about what works and what doesnt work
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/TomWujec_2010U_22.wav so the capacity to play in prototype is is really essential but lets look at how different teams perform
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/TomWujec_2010U_23.wav so the average for most people is around twenty inches business schools students about half of that lawyers a little better but not much better than that kindergarteners better than most adults who does the very best
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/TomWujec_2010U_24.wav architects and engineers thankfully and
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/TomWujec_2010U_26.wav thirty nine inches is the tallest structure i ive seen and why is it because they understand triangles and self re enforcing geometrical patterns are the key to building self reinforce stable structures
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/TomWujec_2010U_27.wav so ceos a little bit better than average but heres where it gets interesting if you put in an executive admin on the team they get significantly better
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/TomWujec_2010U_29.wav terrible you know
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/TomWujec_2010U_30.wav you look around you go oh that teams going to win you can just tell beforehand and why is that because they have specials skills of facilitation they manage the process they understand the process and any team who manages and pays a close attention to to work
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/TomWujec_2010U_31.wav will significantly improve the teams performance specialized skills and facilitation skills are the combination leads to to strong success
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/TomWujec_2010U_32.wav if you have ten teams that typically perform youll get maybe six or so that have standing structures and i i tried something interesting i thought lets
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/TomWujec_2010U_33.wav up the ante once so i offered a ten thousand dollar prize of software to the winning team so what do you think happened to these design students what was the result
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/TomWujec_2010U_34.wav heres what happened
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/TomWujec_2010U_35.wav not one team had a standing structure not one had a a if anyone had built say a one inch structure they could have taken home the prize so isnt it interesting that high stakes have a strong impact we did the exercise again with the same students what do you think happened then so now they understand the value of prototyping
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/TomWujec_2010U_36.wav so the same team went from being the very worst to being among the very best they produced the tallest structures in the least amount of time so theres deep lessons for us about the nature of incentives and success
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/TomWujec_2010U_37.wav so you might ask why would anyone actually spend time writing a marshmallow challenge and the reason is i help create digital tools and processes to help teams build cars and video games and visual effects
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/TomWujec_2010U_38.wav and what the marshmallow challenge does is it helps them identify the hidden assumptions because frankly
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/TomWujec_2010U_39.wav every project has its own marshmallow doesnt it the challenge provides a shared experience a common language a common stance to build the right prototype and so this is the value of the experience of this so simple exercise and those of you who are interested may want to go to marshmallowchallenge dot com its a blog that you can look at how to build the marshmallows theres step by step instructions on this there are
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/TomWujec_2010U_40.wav crazy examples from around the world of how people tweak and adjust the system theres world records on this as well
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/TomWujec_2010U_41.wav and the fundamental lesson i believe is that design truly is a contact sport it demands that we bring all of our senses to the task and that we apply the very best of our thinking our feeling and our doing to the challenge that we have at hand and sometimes a little prototype of this experience is all that it takes to turn us from an uh oh moment to a ta da moment and that can make a big difference thank you very much
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/GaryFlake_2010_1.wav if i can leave you with one big idea today its that the whole of the data in which we consume is greater that the sum of the parts and instead of thinking about information overload
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/GaryFlake_2010_2.wav what id like you to think about is how we can use information so that patterns pop and we can see trends that would otherwise be invisible so what were looking at right here is a typical mortality chart organized by age this
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/GaryFlake_2010_3.wav tool that im using here is a little experiment its called pivot and with pivot what i can do is i can choose to filter in one particular cause of deaths say accidents and right away i see theres a different pattern that emerges
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/GaryFlake_2010_4.wav this is because in the mid area here people are at their most active and over here theyre at their most frail we can step back out again and then reorganize the data by cause of death
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/GaryFlake_2010_5.wav seeing that circulatory diseases and cancer are the usual suspects but not for everyone if we go ahead and we filter
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/GaryFlake_2010_6.wav by age say forty years or less we see that accidents are actually the greatest cause that people have to be worried about
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/GaryFlake_2010_7.wav and if you drill into that its especially the case for men so you get the idea that viewing information viewing data in this way is a lot like
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/GaryFlake_2010_8.wav swimming in an living information info graphic and if we can do this for raw data why not do it for content as well
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/GaryFlake_2010_9.wav so what we have right here is the cover of every single sports illustrated ever produced
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/GaryFlake_2010_10.wav its all here its all on the web you can go back to your rooms and try this after my talk with pivot you can drill into a decade you can drill into a particular year you can jump right into a specific issue
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/GaryFlake_2010_11.wav so im looking at this i see the athletes that have appeared in this issue the sports im a lance armstrong fan so ill go ahead and ill click on that which reveals for me all the issues in which lance armstrongs been a part of
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/GaryFlake_2010_13.wav now if i want to just kind of take a peek at these i might think well what about taking a look at all of cycling so i can step back and expand on that and i see greg lemond now
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/GaryFlake_2010_14.wav and so you get the idea that when you navigate over information this way going narrower broader backing in backing out youre not searching youre not browsing youre doing something thats actually a little bit different its in between and
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/GaryFlake_2010_15.wav we think it changes the way information can be used so i want to extrapolate on this idea a bit with something thats a little bit crazy what were done here is weve taken every single wikipedia page and weve reduced it down to a little summary so the summary consisted of just little synopsis and an icon to indicate the topical area that it comes from im only showing the top five hundred most popular wikipedia pages right here but even in this limited view
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/GaryFlake_2010_16.wav we can do a lot of things right away we get a sense of what are the topical domains that are most popular on wikipedia im going to go ahead and select government
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/GaryFlake_2010_17.wav now having selected government i can now see that the wikipedia categories that most frequently correspond to that are time magazine people of the year
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/GaryFlake_2010_18.wav so this is really important because this is an insight that was not contained within any one wikipedia page its only possible to see that insight when you step back and look at all of them looking at one of these particular summaries i can then drill into the concept of
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/GaryFlake_2010_19.wav time magazine person of the year bringing up all of them so looking at these people i can see that the majority come from government
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/GaryFlake_2010_20.wav some have come from natural sciences
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/GaryFlake_2010_21.wav some fewer still have come from business
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/GaryFlake_2010_23.wav theres my boss and
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/GaryFlake_2010_25.wav one has come from music
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/GaryFlake_2010_27.wav and interestingly enough bono is also a ted prize winner
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/GaryFlake_2010_28.wav so we can go jump and take a look at all the ted prize winners so you see were navigating the web for the first time as if its actually a web not page to page but at a higher level of abstraction
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/GaryFlake_2010_29.wav and so i want to show you one other thing that may catch you a little bit by surprise im just showing the new york times website here so pivot this application i dont want to call it a browser its really not a browser
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/GaryFlake_2010_30.wav but you can view web pages with it and we bring that zoomable technology to every single web page like this so i can step back
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/GaryFlake_2010_31.wav pop right back in to a specific section now the reason why this is important is because by virtue of just viewing web pages in this way i can look at my entire browsing history in the exact same way so i can drill in to what ive done
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/GaryFlake_2010_32.wav over specific time frames here in fact is the state of all the demo that i just gave and i can sort of replay some stuff that i was looking at earlier today
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/GaryFlake_2010_33.wav and if i want to step back and look at everything i can slice and dice my history perhaps by my search history
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/GaryFlake_2010_34.wav here i was doing some nepotistic searching looking for bing over here for live labs pivot and from these i can drill into the web page and just launch them again its one metaphor
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/GaryFlake_2010_35.wav repurposed multiple times and in each case it makes the whole greater than the sum of the parts with the data so
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/GaryFlake_2010_36.wav right now in this world we think about data as being this curse we talk about the curse of information overload we talk about
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/GaryFlake_2010_37.wav drowning in data what if we can actually turn that upside down and turn the web upside down
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/GaryFlake_2010_38.wav so that instead of navigating from one thing to the next we get used to the habit of being able to go from many things to many things and then being able to see the patterns that were otherwise hidden if we can do that then instead
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/GaryFlake_2010_39.wav of being trapped in data we might actually extract information and instead of dealing just with information we can tease out knowledge and if we get the knowledge then maybe even theres wisdom to be found so with that i thank you
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/AimeeMullins_2009P_1.wav id like to share with you a discovery that i made a few months ago while writing an article for italian wired i always keep my thesaurus handy whenever im writing anything but
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/AimeeMullins_2009P_2.wav id already finished editing the piece and i realized that i had never once in my life looked up the word disabled to see what id find let me read you the entry
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/AimeeMullins_2009P_4.wav disabled adjective crippled helpless useless wrecked
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/AimeeMullins_2009P_6.wav stalled maimed wounded mangled lame mutilated
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/AimeeMullins_2009P_7.wav rundown worn out weakened impotent castrated paralyzed handicapped
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/AimeeMullins_2009P_8.wav senile decrepit laid up done up done for done in cracked up counted out
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/AimeeMullins_2009P_10.wav see also hurt useless and weak antonyms healthy strong capable
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/AimeeMullins_2009P_12.wav i was reading this list out loud to a friend and at first was laughing it was so ludicrous but i just gotten past mangled
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/AimeeMullins_2009P_13.wav and my voice broke and i had to stop and collect myself from the emotional shock
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/AimeeMullins_2009P_15.wav uh and and impact that the assault from these words unleashed
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/AimeeMullins_2009P_16.wav you know hum of course this is my raggedy old thesaurus im thinking this must be an ancient print date right but in fact the print date was the early nineteen eighties
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/AimeeMullins_2009P_17.wav when i would have been starting primary school and forming an understanding of myself outside the family unit and as related to the other kids and the world around me and needless to say thank god i wasnt using a thesaurus back then
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/AimeeMullins_2009P_18.wav i mean from this entry it would seem that i was born into a world that perceived someone like me to have nothing positive whatsoever going for them when in fact today
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/AimeeMullins_2009P_19.wav im celebrated for uh the opportunities and adventures my life has procured so uh i immediately
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/AimeeMullins_2009P_20.wav went to look up the two thousand and nine uh online edition expecting to find a revision worth noting heres the updated version of this entry
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/AimeeMullins_2009P_21.wav unfortunately its not much better i find the the last two words under near antonyms particularly unsettling whole and wholesome
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/AimeeMullins_2009P_23.wav so its not just about the words
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/AimeeMullins_2009P_24.wav its what we believe about people when we name them with these words its about the values behind the words and how we construct those values our language affects our thinking
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/AimeeMullins_2009P_25.wav and how we view the world and how we view other people in fact many ancient societies including the greeks and the romans believed that to utter a curse
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/AimeeMullins_2009P_26.wav verbally was so powerful because to say the thing out loud brought it into existence
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/AimeeMullins_2009P_28.wav so what reality do we want to call into existence a person who is limited or a person whos empowered
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/AimeeMullins_2009P_30.wav by casually doing something as simple as naming a person a child
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/AimeeMullins_2009P_31.wav we might be putting lids and casting shadows on their power wouldnt we want to open doors for them instead
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/AimeeMullins_2009P_32.wav one such person who opened doors for me was my childhood doctor at the a i dupont institute in wilmington delaware his name is doctor pizzutillo
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/AimeeMullins_2009P_33.wav hum its an italian american whose name apparently was too difficult for most americans to pronounce so he went by doctor p and doctor p
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/AimeeMullins_2009P_34.wav always wore really colorful bow ties and hum had the very perfect disposition to work with children
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/AimeeMullins_2009P_35.wav i loved almost everything about my time spent at this hospital with the exception of my physical therapy sessions
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/AimeeMullins_2009P_36.wav i had to do what seemed like innumerable repetitions of exercises with these thick elastic bands uh different colors you know
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/AimeeMullins_2009P_37.wav to help build up my leg muscles and i hated these bands more than anything i hated them had names for them i hated them and
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/AimeeMullins_2009P_38.wav you know i was already bargaining as a five year old child with doctor p to try to get out of doing these exercises unsuccessfully of course
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/AimeeMullins_2009P_39.wav and one day he came in to my session hum exhaustive and unforgiving
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/AimeeMullins_2009P_40.wav these sessions and he said to me wow aimee you are such a strong powerful little girl
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/AimeeMullins_2009P_41.wav i think youre going to break one of those bands when you do break it im going to give you a hundred bucks now of course this this was a simple ploy
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/AimeeMullins_2009P_42.wav on doctor ps part to get me to do the exercises i didnt want to do before the prospect of being the richest five year old in the second floor ward
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/AimeeMullins_2009P_43.wav but what he effectively did for me was reshape an awful daily occurrence into a new and promising experience for me
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/AimeeMullins_2009P_44.wav and i have to wonder today to what extent his vision and his declaration of me
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/AimeeMullins_2009P_45.wav as a strong and powerful little girl shaped my own view of myself as an inherently strong powerful and athletic person well into the future
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/AimeeMullins_2009P_46.wav this is an example of how adults in positions of power can ignite the power of a child
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/AimeeMullins_2009P_47.wav but in the previous instances of those thesaurus entries our language isnt allowing us to evolve into the reality that we would all want
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/AimeeMullins_2009P_48.wav the possibility of an individual to see themselves as capable
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/AimeeMullins_2009P_50.wav our language hasnt caught up with the changes in our society many of which have been brought about by technology certainly from a medical standpoint
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/AimeeMullins_2009P_51.wav my legs hum you know laser surgery for vision impairment uh titanium knee and hip replacements for aging bodies that are allowing people to more fully engage with their abilities and move beyond the limits that nature has imposed on them
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/AimeeMullins_2009P_52.wav not to mention social networking platforms allow people to self identify to claim their own descriptions of themselves so they can go align with global groups of their own choosing
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/AimeeMullins_2009P_54.wav so perhaps technology is revealing more clearly to us now what has always been a truth that everyone has something rare and powerful to offer our society
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/AimeeMullins_2009P_56.wav and that the human ability to adapt is our greatest asset the human ability to adapt its an interesting thing because people
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/AimeeMullins_2009P_57.wav have continually wanted to talk to me about overcoming adversity
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/AimeeMullins_2009P_58.wav and im going to make an admission this phrase never sat right with me and i always felt uneasy trying to answer peoples questions about it and i think im starting to figure out why
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/AimeeMullins_2009P_59.wav implicit in this phrase of overcoming adversity is the idea that success or happiness
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/AimeeMullins_2009P_60.wav is about emerging on the other side of a challenging experience unscathed or unmarked by the experience
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/AimeeMullins_2009P_61.wav as if my successes in life have come about from an ability to sidestep or circumnavigate the presumed pitfalls of a life with prosthetics or what other people perceive as my disability
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/AimeeMullins_2009P_62.wav but in fact we are changed we are marked of course by a challenge whether physically emotionally or both and i am going to suggest that this is a good thing
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/AimeeMullins_2009P_63.wav adversity isnt an obstacle that we need to get around in order to resume living our life its part of our life
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/AimeeMullins_2009P_64.wav and i tend to think of it like my shadow sometimes i see a lot of it sometimes theres very little but its always with me
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/AimeeMullins_2009P_65.wav and certainly im not trying to diminish the impact the weight of a persons struggle there is
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/AimeeMullins_2009P_66.wav adversity and challenge in life and its all very real and relative to every single person but the question isnt whether or not youre going to meet adversity but how youre going to meet it
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/AimeeMullins_2009P_67.wav so our responsibility is not simply shielding those we care for from adversity but preparing them to meet it well
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/AimeeMullins_2009P_68.wav and we do a disservice to our kids when we make them feel that theyre not equipped to adapt
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/AimeeMullins_2009P_69.wav theres an important difference and distinction between the objective medical fact of my being an amputee and the subjective societal opinion of whether or not im disabled
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/AimeeMullins_2009P_70.wav and truthfully the only real and consistent disability ive had to confront is the world ever thinking that i could be described by those definitions
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/AimeeMullins_2009P_71.wav in our desire to protect those we care about by giving them the cold hard truth about their medical prognosis
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/AimeeMullins_2009P_72.wav or indeed a prognosis on the expected quality of their life we have to make sure that we dont put the first brick in a wall that will actually
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/AimeeMullins_2009P_73.wav disable someone perhaps the existing model of only looking at what is broken in you and how do we fix it
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/AimeeMullins_2009P_74.wav serves to be more disabling to the individual than the pathology itself by not treating the wholeness of a person
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/AimeeMullins_2009P_75.wav by not acknowledging their potency we are creating another ill on top of whatever natural struggle they might have
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/AimeeMullins_2009P_76.wav we are effectively grading someones worth to our community so we need to see through the pathology and into the range of human capability
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/AimeeMullins_2009P_77.wav and most importantly theres a partnership between those perceived deficiencies and our greatest creative ability
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/AimeeMullins_2009P_78.wav so its not about devaluing or negating these more trying times as something we want to avoid or sweep under the rug but instead to find those opportunities
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/AimeeMullins_2009P_79.wav wrapped in the adversity so maybe the idea i want to put out there is not so much overcoming adversity as it is opening ourselves up to it
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/AimeeMullins_2009P_81.wav embracing it grappling with it to use a wrestling term maybe even dancing with it
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/AimeeMullins_2009P_83.wav and perhaps if we see adversity as natural consistent and useful were less burdened by the presence of it
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/AimeeMullins_2009P_84.wav this year we celebrate the two hundreth birthday of charles darwin and it was one hundred and fifty years ago when writing about evolution that darwin illustrated i think a truth about the human character
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/AimeeMullins_2009P_85.wav to paraphrase its not the strongest of the species that survives nor is it the most intelligent that survives it is the one that is most adaptable to change
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/AimeeMullins_2009P_86.wav conflict is the genesis of creation from darwins work amongst others we can recognize that the human ability to survive and flourish
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/AimeeMullins_2009P_87.wav is driven by the the struggle of the human spirit through conflict into transformation so again transformation adaptation is our greatest
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/AimeeMullins_2009P_88.wav human skill and perhaps you know until were tested we dont know what were made of maybe thats what adversity gives us a sense of self a sense of our own power
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/AimeeMullins_2009P_89.wav so we can give ourselves a gift we can re imagine adversity as something more than just tough times
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/AimeeMullins_2009P_90.wav maybe we can see it as change adversity is just change that we havent adapted ourselves to yet
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/AimeeMullins_2009P_91.wav i think the greatest adversity that weve created for ourselves is this idea of normalcy
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/AimeeMullins_2009P_92.wav now whos normal theres no normal theres common theres typical
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/AimeeMullins_2009P_93.wav theres no normal and would you want to meet that poor beige person if they existed i dont think so if we can change this paradigm from one of
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/AimeeMullins_2009P_94.wav achieving normalcy to one of possibility or potency to be even a little bit more dangerous we can release the power of so many more children and invite them to engage
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/AimeeMullins_2009P_95.wav their rare and valuable abilities with the community anthropologists tell us that the one thing we as humans have always required of our community members is to be of use to be able to contribute
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/AimeeMullins_2009P_96.wav theres evidence that neanderthals sixty thousand years ago carried their elderly and those with serious physical injury
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/AimeeMullins_2009P_97.wav and perhaps its because the life experience of survival of these people proved of value to the community
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/AimeeMullins_2009P_98.wav they didnt view these people as broken and useless they were seen as rare and valuable
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/AimeeMullins_2009P_99.wav few years ago i was in a food market in the town where i grew up in that red zone in northeastern pennsylvania
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/AimeeMullins_2009P_100.wav and i was standing over a bushel of tomatoes it was summer time i had shorts on i hear this guy his voice behind me say well if it isnt aimee mullins
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/AimeeMullins_2009P_101.wav and i turn around and its this older man i have no idea who he is and i said im sorry sir i dont
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/AimeeMullins_2009P_102.wav have we met i i dont remember meeting you he said well you wouldnt remember meeting me i mean when we met i was delivering you from your mothers womb
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/AimeeMullins_2009P_103.wav oh that guy and but of course actually
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/AimeeMullins_2009P_104.wav it did click this man was doctor kean a man i had only known about through my mothers stories of that day because of course
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/AimeeMullins_2009P_105.wav typical fashion i arrived late for my birthday by two weeks an so my mothers prenatal physician had gone on vacation so the man who delivered me was a complete stranger to my parents
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/AimeeMullins_2009P_106.wav and because i was born without the fibula bones and had feet turned in and a few toes in this foot and a few toes in that he had to be the bearer this stranger
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/AimeeMullins_2009P_107.wav had to be the bearer of bad news he said to me i had to give this prognosis to your parents that you would never walk
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/AimeeMullins_2009P_108.wav and you would never have the kind of mobility that other kids have or any kind of life of independence and youve been making liar out of me ever since
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/AimeeMullins_2009P_110.wav the extraordinary thing is that he said he had saved newspaper clipping throughout my whole childhood
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/AimeeMullins_2009P_111.wav whether winning a second grade spelling bee marching with the girl scouts you know the halloween parade winning my college scholarship or any of my sports victories
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/AimeeMullins_2009P_112.wav and he was using it and integrating it into teaching uh resident students med students from hahnemann
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/AimeeMullins_2009P_113.wav medical school and hershey medical school and he called this part of the course the x factor the potential of the human will
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/AimeeMullins_2009P_114.wav no prognosis can account for how powerful this could be and a as a determinant in the quality of someones life
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/AimeeMullins_2009P_115.wav and doctor kean went on to tell me that he said in my experience unless repeatedly told otherwise
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/AimeeMullins_2009P_116.wav and even if given a modicum of support if left to their own devices a child will achieve
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/AimeeMullins_2009P_117.wav see doctor kean made that shift in thinking he understood that theres a difference between the medical condition and what someone might do with it
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/AimeeMullins_2009P_118.wav and theres been a shift in my thinking over time in that if youd asked me at fifteen years old if i would have traded prosthetics for flesh and bone legs i wouldnt have hesitated for a second
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/AimeeMullins_2009P_119.wav i aspired to that kind of normalcy back then if you ask me today im not so sure
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/AimeeMullins_2009P_120.wav and its because of the experiences ive had with them not in spite of the experiences ive had with them
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/AimeeMullins_2009P_121.wav and perhaps this shift in me has happened because ive been exposed to more people who have opened doors for me than those who have put lids and cast shadows on me
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/AimeeMullins_2009P_122.wav see all you really need is one person to show you the epiphany of your own power and youre off if you can hand somebody the key
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/AimeeMullins_2009P_123.wav to their own power the human spirit is so receptive if you can do that and open a door for someone at a crucial moment you are educating them in the best sense
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/AimeeMullins_2009P_124.wav youre teaching them to open doors for themselves in fact the the exact meaning of the word educate
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/AimeeMullins_2009P_125.wav comes from the root word educe it means to bring forth what is within to bring out potential so again which potential do we want to bring out
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/AimeeMullins_2009P_127.wav there was a case study done in nineteen sixties in britain when they were moving from grammar schools to comprehensive schools its called the streaming trials we call it tracking
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/AimeeMullins_2009P_128.wav here in the states its separating students from a b c d and so on
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/AimeeMullins_2009P_129.wav and you know the a students get the tougher curriculum the best teachers etc well they took over a three month period d level students gave them as told them they were as told them they were bright and at the end of this three month period
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/AimeeMullins_2009P_130.wav they were performing at a level and of course the heartbreaking flip side of this study is that they took the a students
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/AimeeMullins_2009P_131.wav and told them they were ds and thats what happened at the end of that three month period those who were still around in school besides the people who had dropped out
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/AimeeMullins_2009P_133.wav this is a crucial part of this case study was that the teachers were duped too
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/AimeeMullins_2009P_134.wav the teachers didnt know a switch had been made they were simply told these are the a students these are the d students and thats how they went about teaching them
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/AimeeMullins_2009P_135.wav and treating them so i think
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/AimeeMullins_2009P_136.wav that the only true disability
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/AimeeMullins_2009P_137.wav is a crushed spirit a spirit thats been crushed doesnt have hope it doesnt see beauty
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/AimeeMullins_2009P_138.wav it no longer has our natural childlike curiosity and our innate ability to imagine
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/AimeeMullins_2009P_140.wav if instead we can bolster a human spirit to keep hope to see beauty in themselves and others
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/AimeeMullins_2009P_141.wav to be curious and imaginative then we are truly using our power well
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/AimeeMullins_2009P_142.wav when a spirit has those qualities we are able to create new realities and new ways of being
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/AimeeMullins_2009P_143.wav id like to leave you with a poem by a fourteenth century persian poet named hafiz
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/AimeeMullins_2009P_144.wav that my friend jacques dembois told me about and the poem is called the god who only knows four words every child
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/AimeeMullins_2009P_145.wav has known god not the god of names not the god of donts but the god who only knows four words
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/AimeeMullins_2009P_146.wav and keeps repeating them saying come dance with me come dance with me thank you
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/BillGates_2010_1.wav im going to talk today about energy and climate
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/BillGates_2010_2.wav and that might seem a bit surprising because my full time work at the foundation is mostly about vaccines and seeds about the things that we need to invent and deliver to help the poorest two billion live better lives
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/BillGates_2010_3.wav but energy and climate are extremely important to these people in fact more important than to anyone else on the planet
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/BillGates_2010_4.wav the climate getting worse means that many years their crops wont grow there will be too much rain not enough rain
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/BillGates_2010_6.wav things will change in ways that their fragile environment simply cant support and that leads to starvation it leads to uncertainty it leads to unrest so the the climate changes will be terrible for them
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/BillGates_2010_7.wav also the price of energy is very important to them in fact if you could pick just one thing to lower the price of to reduce poverty by far you would pick energy now the price of energy has come down over time
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/BillGates_2010_8.wav uh really advanced civilization is based on advances in energy the coal revolution fueled
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/BillGates_2010_9.wav the industrial revolution and even in the nineteen hundreds weve seen a very rapid decline in the price of electricity and thats why we have refrigerators air conditioning we can make uh modern materials and do so many things
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/BillGates_2010_10.wav and so were in a wonderful situation with uh electricity in the rich world
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/BillGates_2010_12.wav but as we make it cheaper and lets say lets go for making it twice as cheap we need to meet a new constraint
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/BillGates_2010_13.wav and that constraint has to do with co two co two is warming the planet
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/BillGates_2010_14.wav and the equation on co two is actually a very straightforward one if you sum up the co two that gets emitted
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/BillGates_2010_15.wav that leads to a temperature increase and that temperature increase leads to some very negative effects the effects on the weather
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/BillGates_2010_16.wav and perhaps worse the indirect effects in that the natural ecosystems cant adjust to these rapid changes and so you get ecosystem collapses
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/BillGates_2010_17.wav now the exact amount of how you map from a a certain increase of co two
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/BillGates_2010_18.wav to what temperature will be and where the positive feedbacks are theres some uncertainty there but not very much and theres certainly uncertainty about how bad those effects will be but they will be extremely bad
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/BillGates_2010_19.wav i asked the top scientists on this several times do we really have to get down to near zero cant we just you know cut it in half or a quarter and the answer is that until we get near to zero
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/BillGates_2010_20.wav the temperature will continue to rise and so thats thats a big challenge its very different than saying you know were a twelve feet high truck trying to get under a ten feet bridge and we can just sort of squeeze under this is something that has to get to zero
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/BillGates_2010_22.wav now we put out a lot of carbon dioxide every year over twenty six billion tons for each american
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/BillGates_2010_23.wav its about twenty tons uh for people in poor countries its less than one ton its an average of about five tons for everyone on the planet and somehow we have to make changes that will bring that down to zero
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/BillGates_2010_24.wav its been constantly going up its only various economic changes that have even flattened it at all so we have to go from rapidly rising to falling and falling all the way to zero this equation has four factors
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/BillGates_2010_25.wav a little bit of multiplication so youve got a thing on the left co two that you want to get to zero and thats going to be based on the number of people
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/BillGates_2010_26.wav the services each persons using on average the energy on average for each service and the co two being put out
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/BillGates_2010_27.wav per unit of energy so lets look at each one of these and see how we can get this down to zero uh probably one of these numbers is going to have to get pretty near to zero now
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/BillGates_2010_28.wav and thats back from high school algebra but lets lets take a look first weve got population
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/BillGates_2010_29.wav now the world today has six point eight billion people thats headed up to about nine billion now if we do a really great job on new vaccines health care
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/BillGates_2010_30.wav reproductive health services we could lower that by perhaps ten or fifteen percent but there we see an increase of about one point three
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/BillGates_2010_31.wav the second factor is the services we use this encompasses everything the food we eat
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/BillGates_2010_32.wav clothing tv heating these are very good things and getting rid of poverty means providing these services to almost everyone on the planet and its a great thing
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/BillGates_2010_33.wav for this number to go up in the rich world perhaps the top one billion we probably could cut back and use less but every year
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/BillGates_2010_34.wav this number on average is going to go up and so over all that will more than double the services delivered per person
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/BillGates_2010_35.wav here we have a very basic service do you have lighting in your house to be able to read your homework and in fact these kids dont so theyre going out and reading their school work under the street lamps
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/BillGates_2010_37.wav now efficiency e the energy for each service here finally we have some good news we have something thats not going up through various inventions and new ways of doing lighting
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/BillGates_2010_38.wav through different types of cars different ways of building buildings there are a lot of services where you can bring the energy for that service down quite substantially
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/BillGates_2010_39.wav some individual services even bring it down by ninety percent there are other services like how we make fertilizer or how we do air transport where the rooms for improvement are far far less
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/BillGates_2010_40.wav and so overall here if were optimistic we may get a reduction of a a factor of three to even perhaps a factor of six
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/BillGates_2010_41.wav but for these first three factors now weve gone from twenty six billion to at best maybe thirteen billion tons and that just wont cut it so lets look at this fourth factor this is going to be a key one
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/BillGates_2010_42.wav and this is the amount of co two put out per each unit of energy and so the question is can you actually get that to zero if you burn coal
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/BillGates_2010_43.wav no if you burn natural gas no almost every way we make electricity today except for the emerging renewables and nuclear puts out co two and so what were going to have to do at a global scale
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/BillGates_2010_44.wav is create a new system and so we need energy miracles now when i use the term miracle i dont mean something thats impossible
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/BillGates_2010_46.wav the microprocessor is a miracle the personal computer is a miracle the internet and its services are a miracle so the people here have participated in the creation of many miracles usually we dont have a deadline
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/BillGates_2010_47.wav where you have to get the miracle by a certain date usually you just kind of stand by and some come along some dont this is a case where we actually have to drive it full speed and get a miracle in a a pretty tight time line
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/BillGates_2010_48.wav now i thought how could i really capture this is there some kind of natural illustration some demonstration that would grab peoples imagination here
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/BillGates_2010_49.wav i thought back to a year ago when i brought mosquitos and somehow people enjoyed that
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/BillGates_2010_51.wav it it really got them involved in the idea of you know there are people who live with mosquitos so with energy all i could come up with is this i decided that releasing fireflies
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/BillGates_2010_52.wav would be my contribution to the environment here this year so here we have some natural fireflies im told they dont bite in fact they might not even not even leave that jar
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/BillGates_2010_54.wav now theres all sorts gimmicky solutions like that one but they dont really add up too much we need solutions either one or several that have
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/BillGates_2010_55.wav unbelievable scale and unbelievable reliability and although theres many directions of people seeking i really only see five that
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/BillGates_2010_56.wav can achieve the big numbers ive left out tide geothermal fusion biofuels those may make some contribution and if they can do better than i expect so much the better but my key point here
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/BillGates_2010_57.wav is that were going to have to work on each of these five and we cant give up any of them because they they look daunting because they all
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/BillGates_2010_58.wav have significant challenges lets look first at the burning fossil fuels either burning coal or burning natural gas what you need to do there
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/BillGates_2010_60.wav seems like it might be simple but its not and thats to take all the co two after youve burned it going out the flue pressurize it create a liquid put it somewhere and hope it stays there
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/BillGates_2010_61.wav now we have some pilot things that do this at the sixty to eighty percent level but getting up to that full percentage that will be very tricky and agreeing on where these co two quantities should be put
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/BillGates_2010_62.wav will be hard but the toughest one here is this long term issue whos going to be sure whos going to guarantee
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/BillGates_2010_63.wav something that is literally billions of times larger than any type of waste you think of in in terms of nuclear or other things this is a lot of volume
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/BillGates_2010_64.wav so thats a tough one next would be nuclear it also has three big problems cost particularly in highly regulated countries is high
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/BillGates_2010_65.wav the issue of the safety really feeling good about nothing could go wrong that even though you have these human operators that the fuel
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/BillGates_2010_66.wav doesnt get used for weapons and then what do you do with the waste and although its not very large there are a lot of concerns about that people need to feel good about it so three very tough problems that might be solvable and so should be worked on
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/BillGates_2010_67.wav the last three of the five ive grouped together these are what people often refer to as the renewable sources and they actually
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/BillGates_2010_68.wav although its great they dont require fuel they have some disadvantages one is that the density
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/BillGates_2010_69.wav of energy gathered in these technologies is dramatically less than a power plant this is energy farming
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/BillGates_2010_70.wav so youre talking about many square miles thousands of time more area than than you think of as a normal energy plant also these are intermittent sources the sun doesnt shine
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/BillGates_2010_71.wav all day it doesnt shine every day and likewise the wind doesnt blow all the time and so if you depend on these sources
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/BillGates_2010_72.wav you have to have some way of getting the energy during those time periods that its not available so weve got big cost challenges here
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/BillGates_2010_73.wav we have transmission challenges for example say this energy source is outside your country you not only need the technology but you have to deal with the risk of the energy coming from elsewhere and finally this storage problem
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/BillGates_2010_74.wav and to dimensionalize this i went through and looked at all the types of batteries that get made for cars for computers for phones for flashlights for everything and compared that
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/BillGates_2010_75.wav to the amount of electrical energy the world uses and what i found is that all the batteries we make now could store less than ten minutes
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/BillGates_2010_76.wav of all the energy and so in fact we need a big breakthrough here something thats going to be
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/BillGates_2010_77.wav a factor of a hundred better than the approaches we have now its not its not impossible but its not a very easy thing now this shows up when you try to get the the intermittent source to be above say twenty to thirty percent
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/BillGates_2010_78.wav of what youre using if youre counting on it for a hundred percent you need a an incredible miracle battery
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/BillGates_2010_79.wav now how were going to go forward on this whats whats the right approach is it a manhattan project whats the the thing that can get us there well we need lots
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/BillGates_2010_80.wav of companies working on this hundreds in each of these five paths we need at least a hundred people and a lot of them youll look at and say theyre crazy thats good
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/BillGates_2010_81.wav and i think here in the ted group we have many people who are already pursuing this
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/BillGates_2010_82.wav bill gross has several companies including one called esolar that has some great solar thermal technologies vinod khoslas investing in dozens of companies that are doing great things and have interesting possibilities and im im trying to help back that nathan myhrvold and i actually are backing a company
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/BillGates_2010_83.wav that perhaps surprisingly is actually taking the nuclear approach there are some innovations in nuclear modular liquid
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/BillGates_2010_84.wav and innovation really stopped in this industry quite some time ago so the idea that theres some good ideas laying around is not all that surprising the idea of terrapower
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/BillGates_2010_85.wav is that instead of burning a part of uranium the one percent which is the u two thirty five we decided lets burn the ninety nine percent
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/BillGates_2010_86.wav the u two thirty eight it is kind of a crazy idea in fact people had talked about it for a long time
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/BillGates_2010_87.wav but they could never simulate properly whether it would work or not and so its through the advent of modern supercomputers that now you can simulate and see that yes with the right
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/BillGates_2010_88.wav materials approach this looks like it would work and because youre burning that ninety nine percent you have
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/BillGates_2010_89.wav greatly improved cost profile you actually burn up the waste and you can actually use as fuel all the leftover waste from todays reactors so instead of worrying about them you just take that its a great thing
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/BillGates_2010_90.wav it breathes this uranium as it goes along so its kind of like a candle you can see its its a log there often referred to as a traveling wave reactor in terms of fuel
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/BillGates_2010_91.wav this really solves the problem ive got a picture here of a place in kentucky this is the left over the ninety nine percent where theyve taken out the part they burn now so its called depleted uranium that would power the u s
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/BillGates_2010_92.wav for hundreds of years and simply by filtering sea water in an inexpensive process youd have enough fuel for the entire lifetime of the rest of the planet so
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/BillGates_2010_93.wav you know its got lots lots of challenges ahead but it is an example of the many hundreds and hundreds of ideas that we need to move forward
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/BillGates_2010_94.wav so lets think how should we measure ourselves what should our report card look like well lets go out to where we really need to get and and then look at the intermediate for twenty fifty youve heard many people talk about
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/BillGates_2010_95.wav this eighty percent reduction that really is very important that we get there and that twenty percent will be used up by
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/BillGates_2010_96.wav things going on in poor countries still some agriculture hopefully we will have cleaned up forestry cement so to get to that eighty percent the developed countries
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/BillGates_2010_97.wav including countries like china will have had to switch their electric electricity generation altogether so the other grade is are we deploying
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/BillGates_2010_98.wav this zero emission technology have we deployed it in all the developed countries and were in the process of of getting it elsewhere thats super important
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/BillGates_2010_99.wav thats a key element of making that report card so backing up from there what should the twenty twenty report card look like
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/BillGates_2010_100.wav well it again it should have the two elements we should go through these efficiency measures to start getting reductions the less we emit the less that sum will be of co two and therefore the less the temperature but in some ways the grade we get there
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/BillGates_2010_101.wav doing things that dont get us all the way to the big reductions is only equally or maybe even slightly less important than the other which is the piece of innovation
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/BillGates_2010_102.wav on these breakthroughs these breakthroughs we need to move those at full speed and we can measure that in terms of companies pilot projects regulatory things that have been changed
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/BillGates_2010_103.wav theres a lot of great books that have been written about this the al gore book our choice and the david mckay book sustainable energy without the hot air they really go through it and i think create a framework that this can be discussed broadly because we need broad backing for this
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/BillGates_2010_104.wav theres a lot that has to come together so this is a wish its a very concrete wish that
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/BillGates_2010_105.wav we invent this technology if you gave me only one wish for the next fifty years i could pick whos president i could pick a vaccine
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/BillGates_2010_106.wav which is something i love or i could pick that this thing thats half the cost with no co two gets invented
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/BillGates_2010_107.wav this is the wish i would pick this is the one with the greatest impact if we dont get this wish the division between the people who think short term and long term will be terrible
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/BillGates_2010_108.wav between u s and china between poor countries and rich and most of all the lives of those two billion will be far worse so what do we have to do what am i appealing to you to step forward and
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/BillGates_2010_109.wav and drive we need to go for more research funding when countries get together in places like copenhagen they shouldnt
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/BillGates_2010_110.wav just discuss the co two they should discuss this innovation agenda and youd be stunned at the ridiculously low levels of spending
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/BillGates_2010_111.wav on these innovative approaches we do need the market incentives co two tax cap and trade something that gets that price signal out there
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/BillGates_2010_112.wav we need to get the message out we need to have this dialogue be a more rational more understandable dialogue including the steps that the government takes this is an important wish but it is one i think we can achieve thank you
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/BillGates_2010_114.wav thank you thank you
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/BillGates_2010_116.wav thank you just so i understand more about about terrapower right
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/BillGates_2010_117.wav i mean first of all what can you give a sense of what scale of investment this is
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/BillGates_2010_118.wav to to actually do the software buy the supercomputer hire all the great scientists which weve done thats only tens of millions and even once we test our materials out
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/BillGates_2010_119.wav in a russian reactor to make sure that our materials work properly then youll only be up in the hundreds of millions the tough thing is building the pilot reactor
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/BillGates_2010_120.wav finding the several billion finding the regulator the location that will actually build the first one of these once you get the first one built
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/BillGates_2010_121.wav if it works as advertised then its just clear as day because the economics the energy density are so different than nuclear as we know it
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/BillGates_2010_122.wav and so to understand it right this involves building deep into the ground almost like a vertical kind of column of nuclear fuel of this sort of spent uranium and then and then and then the process starts at the top and kind of works down
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/BillGates_2010_123.wav thats right today youre always refueling the reactor so you have lots of people and lots of controls that can go wrong that thing where youre opening it up and moving things in and out thats
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/BillGates_2010_124.wav thats not good so if you have very very cheap fuel that you can put sixty years in just think of it as a log
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/BillGates_2010_125.wav put it down and not have those same complexities and it just sits there and burns for the sixty years and and then its done
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/BillGates_2010_126.wav its a its a nuclear power plant that is its own waste disposal solution
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/BillGates_2010_127.wav yeah well what happens with the waste you can you can let it sit there theres a lot less waste under this approach then you can actually take that and put it into another one and burn that
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/BillGates_2010_128.wav and and we start off actually by taking the waste that exists today thats sitting in these cooling pools or dry casking by reactors thats our fuel
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/BillGates_2010_129.wav to begin with so the thing thats been a problem from those reactors is actually what gets fed into ours and youre reducing the volume of the waste quite dramatically as youre going through this process
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/BillGates_2010_130.wav but in your talking to different people around the world about the possibilities here where where is there most interest in actually doing something with this
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/BillGates_2010_131.wav well we havent uh picked a particular place uh and theres all these interesting disclosure rules about anything thats called nuclear
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/BillGates_2010_133.wav so we we weve got a lot of interest that people from the company have been in russia india china ive been back seeing the secretary of energy here talking about how this
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/BillGates_2010_134.wav fits into the the energy agenda so im optimistic you know the french and japanese have done some work this is a a variant on something that has been done its an important
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/BillGates_2010_135.wav advance but its like a fast reactor and a lot of countries have built them so anybody whos done a fast reactor is a candidate to to be where the first one gets built
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/BillGates_2010_136.wav so in in your mind timescale and likelihood of actually taking something like this live
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/BillGates_2010_137.wav well we need for one of these
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/BillGates_2010_138.wav high scale electro electro generation things thats very cheap we have twenty years to invent and then twenty years to deploy thats sort of the deadline
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/BillGates_2010_139.wav that the environment models environmental models have have have shown us that we have to meet and you know terrapower if things go well
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/BillGates_2010_140.wav which is wishing for a lot could easily meet that and there are fortunately now dozens of companies we need it to be hundreds
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/BillGates_2010_141.wav who likewise if their science goes well if the funding for their pilot pilot plants goes well that they they can compete for this and its best if multiple succeed because then you could use a mix a mix of these things we certainly need one to succeed
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/BillGates_2010_142.wav in terms of big scale possible game changes is this the biggest that youre aware of out there
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/BillGates_2010_143.wav an energy breakthrough is the the most important thing it would have been even without the environmental constraint but the environmental constraint just makes it so much
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/BillGates_2010_145.wav so much greater in the nuclear space there are other innovators you know we dont know their work as well as we know this one but
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/BillGates_2010_146.wav the modular people thats a different approach theres a liquid type reactor which seems a little hard but maybe they say that about us
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/BillGates_2010_148.wav and so there there are different ones but the beauty of this is a molecule of uranium has a million times as much energy as a molecule of say coal
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/BillGates_2010_150.wav and so if you can deal with the negatives which are essentially the radiation the footprint and cost the potential in terms of effect on land and various things is almost in a class of its own
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/BillGates_2010_152.wav if this doesnt work
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/BillGates_2010_154.wav then what do we have to start taking emergency measures to try and keep the temperature of the earth stable
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/BillGates_2010_155.wav yeah if you get into that situation its like
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/BillGates_2010_156.wav if youve
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/BillGates_2010_157.wav youve been over eating and youre about to have a heart attack you know then then then where do you go you may need heart surgery or something there is a line of research on whats called geoengineering
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/BillGates_2010_158.wav which are various techniques that would delay the heating to buy us twenty or thirty years to get our act together
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/BillGates_2010_159.wav now you hope thats just an insurance policy you hope you dont need to do that some people say you shouldnt even work on the insurance policy because it might make you
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/BillGates_2010_160.wav lazy that youll keep eating because you know heart surgery will be there to save you im not sure thats wise given the importance of the problem but
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/BillGates_2010_161.wav theres now the the geoengineering discussion about should that be in the back pocket in case things happen faster or this innovation goes a lot slower than we expect
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/BillGates_2010_163.wav climate skeptics if you had a a sentence or two to say to them how how might you persuade them that theyre wrong
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/BillGates_2010_165.wav well unfortunately the skeptics come in different camps i mean the ones who make scientific arguments are very few
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/BillGates_2010_166.wav you know are they saying theres negative feedback effects that have to do with clouds that offset things there are very very few things that they can even say you know theres a chance in a million of those things the main problem we have here
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/BillGates_2010_167.wav is kind of like aids you make the mistake now and you pay for it a lot later and so when you have all sorts of urgent problems the idea of taking pain now
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/BillGates_2010_168.wav that has to do with a gain later and a somewhat uncertain pain thing in fact the ipcc report you know that
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/BillGates_2010_169.wav thats not necessarily the worst case and there are people in the rich world who look at ipcc and say okay you know that that isnt that big of a deal the fact is its that uncertain part
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/BillGates_2010_170.wav that should move us towards this but my dream here is that if you can make it economic and meet the co two constraints then the skeptics say okay
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/BillGates_2010_171.wav i dont care that it doesnt put out co two i kind of wish it did put out co two but i guess ill accept it because its cheaper
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/BillGates_2010_172.wav than whats come before
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/BillGates_2010_174.wav so
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/BillGates_2010_176.wav is that would be your response to the the the bjorn lomborg argument that basically if you if you spend all this energy trying to solve the co two problem its going to take away all your other goals of trying to rid the world of poverty and malaria and so forth its its its a stupid waste of the earths resources to put money towards that when there are better things we can do
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/BillGates_2010_177.wav yeah well the actual spending on the r and d piece you know say the u s should spend ten billion a year more than it is right now its not that dramatic it shouldnt take away from other things the thing you get into big money on
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/BillGates_2010_178.wav and this reasonable people can disagree is when you have something thats non economic and youre trying to fund that that to me mostly is a waste unless youre very close and youre just funding the learning curve and its going to get very cheap i believe we should try you know more
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/BillGates_2010_179.wav things that have a potential to be far less expensive if the trade off you get into is lets make energy super super
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/BillGates_2010_180.wav expensive then the rich can afford that i mean all of us here could pay five times as much for our energy and not change our lifestyle
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/BillGates_2010_181.wav the disaster is for that two billion and even lomborg has changed his shtick now is why isnt the r and d
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/BillGates_2010_182.wav getting more discussed he hes still because of his earlier stuff further associated with the skeptic camp but hes realized thats thats a pretty lonely camp and so
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/BillGates_2010_183.wav hes making the r and d point and and so there is a a a thread of something that i i think is appropriate the r and d piece its crazy how little its funded
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/BillGates_2010_185.wav well bill i suspect i i speak on the behalf of most people here to say i really hope your wish comes true thank you so much
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/BillGates_2010_186.wav thank you
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_1.wav so ive known a lot of fish in my life
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_2.wav ive loved only two
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_3.wav that first one was a
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_4.wav it was more like a passionate affair
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_5.wav it was a beautiful fish
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_6.wav flavorful textured
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_7.wav meaty a best seller on the menu what a fish
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_9.wav even better it was farm raised to the supposed highest standards of sustainability
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_11.wav so you could feel good about selling it
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_13.wav i was in a relationship with this beauty for several months
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_15.wav one day the head of the company called and asked if id speak at an event
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_17.wav about the farms sustainability absolutely i said
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_19.wav here was a company trying to solve
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_20.wav whats become this unimaginable problem for our chefs
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_22.wav how do we keep fish on our menus
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_24.wav for the past fifty years weve been fishing the seas
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_25.wav like we clear cut forests
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_27.wav its hard to overstate the destruction
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_28.wav ninety percent of large fish the ones we love the tunas the halibuts the salmons swordfish theyve collapsed there was nothing left
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_30.wav so for better or for worse aquaculture fish farming is going to be a part of our future
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_31.wav a lot of arguments against it
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_32.wav fish farms pollute
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_33.wav most of them do anyway and theyre inefficient take tuna a major drawback
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_35.wav its got a feed conversion ratio of fifteen to one that means it takes fifteen pounds of wild fish to get you one pound of farm tuna
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_36.wav not very sustainable doesnt taste very good either
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_38.wav so here finally
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_40.wav was a company trying to do it right i wanted to support them
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_42.wav the day before the event i called the head of pr for the company
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_43.wav lets call him don
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_44.wav don i said just to get the facts straight you guys are famous for for farming so far out to sea you you dont pollute thats right he said were so far out
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_45.wav the waste from our fish gets distributed
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_46.wav not concentrated and then he added
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_47.wav were basically a world unto ourselves
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_49.wav that feed conversion ratio two point five to one he said best in the business
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_51.wav two point five to one great two point five to one what what are you feeding sustainable proteins he said
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_53.wav great i said got off the phone
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_55.wav and that night i was lying in bed and i thought
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_57.wav what the hell is a sustainable protein
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_59.wav so the next day just before the event i called don i said don what are some examples of sustainable proteins he said he didnt know
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_61.wav he would ask around well i got on the phone with a few people in the company no one could give me a straight answer
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_63.wav until finally i got on the phone with the head biologist
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_65.wav lets call him don too
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_67.wav don i said what are some examples of sustainable proteins
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_69.wav well he mentioned some algaes
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_70.wav and some fish meals and then he said chicken pellets
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_72.wav i said chicken pellets he said yeah feathers skin
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_74.wav bone meal scraps dried and processed into feed
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_75.wav i said what percentage
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_76.wav of your feed is chicken
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_78.wav thinking you know two percent
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_80.wav well its about thirty percent he said
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_82.wav i said don
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_83.wav whats sustainable about feeding chicken to fish
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_85.wav there there was a long pause on the line
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_87.wav and he said theres just too much chicken in the world
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_89.wav i fell out of love with this fish
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_91.wav no not because im some self righteous goody two shoes foodie
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_93.wav i actually am
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_95.wav no i fell out of love with this fish because i swear to god after that conversation the fish tasted like chicken
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_97.wav this second fish
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_99.wav its a different kind of love story
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_101.wav its the romantic kind
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_103.wav the kind where the more you get to know your fish you love the fish
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_105.wav i first ate it at a restaurant in southern spain
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_107.wav a journalist friend had been talking about this fish for a long time
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_108.wav she kind of set us up
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_110.wav ok it came to the table a bright
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_111.wav almost shimmering white color
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_113.wav the chef had overcooked it like twice over ok amazingly it was still delicious
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_115.wav who can make a fish taste good
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_117.wav after its been overcooked
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_118.wav i cant but this guy can
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_119.wav lets call him miguel actually his name is miguel
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_121.wav and no he didnt cook the fish and hes not a chef at least in the way that you and i understand it
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_122.wav hes a biologist
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_123.wav at veta la palma its a fish farm in the southwestern corner of spain
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_125.wav its at the tip of the guadalquivir river
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_127.wav until the nineteen eighties the farm was in the hands of the argentinians
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_129.wav they raised beef cattle on what was essentially wetlands
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_131.wav they did it by draining the land they built this intricate series of canals
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_133.wav and they pushed water off the land and out into the river
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_135.wav well they couldnt make it work not economically
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_136.wav and ecologically it was a disaster
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_138.wav killed like ninety percent of the birds which for this place is a lot of birds
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_140.wav and so in nineteen eighty two
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_142.wav a spanish company with an environmental conscience purchased the land what did they do
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_144.wav they reversed the flow of water they literally flipped the switch
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_146.wav instead of pushing water out
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_147.wav they used the channels to pull water back in they flooded the canals
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_149.wav they created a twenty seven thousand acre fish farm
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_150.wav bass mullet shrimp eel
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_151.wav and in the process miguel and this company
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_152.wav completely reversed the ecological destruction
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_154.wav the farms incredible i mean youve never seen anything like this
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_156.wav you stare out at a horizon that is a million miles away and all you see are flooded canals and this thick rich marshland
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_158.wav i was there not long ago with miguel
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_160.wav hes an amazing guy
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_162.wav like three parts charles darwin and one part crocodile dundee
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_164.wav okay
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_165.wav there we are slogging through the wetlands
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_167.wav and im panting and sweating got mud up to my knees and miguels calmly conducting a biology lecture
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_169.wav here hes pointing out a rare black shouldered kite
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_170.wav now hes mentioning
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_171.wav the mineral needs of phytoplankton
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_172.wav and here here he sees a grouping pattern that reminds him of the tanzanian giraffe
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_174.wav it turns out miguel spent the better part of his career in the mikumi national park in africa
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_176.wav i asked him how he became such an expert on fish he said fish
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_178.wav i didnt know anything about fish
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_179.wav im an expert in relationships
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_180.wav and then hes off
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_181.wav launching into more talk about rare birds and algaes and strange aquatic plants and dont get me wrong that was really fascinating you know the biotic community unplugged kind of thing you know its great
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_182.wav but i was in love and my head
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_183.wav was swooning over that overcooked piece of delicious fish i had the night before so i interrupted him i said miguel what makes your fish taste so good
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_184.wav he pointed at the algae
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_185.wav i know dude the algae the phytoplankton the relationships its amazing
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_187.wav but what are your fish eating whats the feed conversion ratio
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_189.wav well he goes on to tell me
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_191.wav its such a rich system
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_193.wav that the fish are eating what theyd be eating in the wild
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_195.wav the plant biomass the phytoplankton the zooplankton its what feeds the fish the system is so healthy its totally self renewing there
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_196.wav there is no feed
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_197.wav ever heard of a farm that doesnt feed its animals
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_199.wav later that day i was driving around this property with miguel and i asked him i said for a place that seems so natural
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_201.wav unlike like any fish any farm id ever been at
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_203.wav how do you measure success
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_205.wav at that moment it was as if a film director called for a set change and we rounded the corner and saw the most amazing sight thousands and thousands of pink flamingos
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_207.wav a literal pink carpet for as far as you could see
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_209.wav thats success he said
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_211.wav look at their bellies pink theyre feasting
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_213.wav feasting i was totally confused i said miguel arent they feasting on your fish
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_215.wav yes he said
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_217.wav we lose twenty percent of our fish and fish eggs to birds
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_219.wav well the last year this property had six hundred thousand birds on it
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_221.wav more than two hundred and fifty different species its become today the largest
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_223.wav and one of the most important
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_225.wav private bird sanctuaries in all of europe
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_227.wav i said miguel isnt a thriving bird population like the last thing you want on a fish farm
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_229.wav he shook his head no he said
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_230.wav we farm extensively
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_232.wav not intensively
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_234.wav this is an ecological network
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_236.wav the flamingos eat the shrimp the shrimp eat the phytoplankton so the pinker the belly the better the system
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_238.wav okay so lets review a farm that doesnt feed its animals
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_240.wav and a farm that measures its success
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_242.wav on the health of its predators
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_244.wav a fish farm but also a bird sanctuary
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_246.wav oh and by the way those flamingos they shouldnt even be there in the first place
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_248.wav they brood in a town a hundred and fifty miles away where the soil conditions are better for building nests
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_250.wav every morning they fly one hundred and fifty miles into the farm
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_252.wav and every evening they fly one hundred and fifty miles back
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_254.wav they do that because theyre able to follow the broken white line of highway a ninety two
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_256.wav no kidding
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_258.wav you know i was imagining a march of the penguins thing you know so i looked at miguel i said
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_259.wav miguel do they fly one hundred and fifty miles to the farm
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_260.wav and then do they fly one hundred and fifty miles back at night
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_262.wav do they do that for the children
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_264.wav he looked at me like i had just quoted a whitney houston song
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_266.wav he said no they do it because the foods better
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_268.wav you know i didnt mention the skin of my beloved fish
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_270.wav which was delicious and i dont like fish skin i dont like it seared i dont like it crispy
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_272.wav its that acrid tar like flavor
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_273.wav i almost never cook with it
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_274.wav yet when i tasted it at that restaurant in southern spain it tasted not at all like fish skin
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_276.wav it tasted sweet and clean
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_278.wav like you were taking a bite of the ocean
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_280.wav i mentioned that to miguel and he nodded he said the skin acts like a sponge its the last defense before anything enters the body it evolved
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_281.wav to soak up impurities and then he added
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_283.wav but our water has no impurities
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_285.wav okay a farm that doesnt feed its fish
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_287.wav a farm that measures its success
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_288.wav by the success of its predators
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_290.wav and then i realized when he says
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_291.wav a farm that has no impurities he made a big understatement because the water that flows through that farm comes in from the guadalquivir river
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_293.wav its a river that carries with it all the things that rivers tend to carry these days
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_295.wav chemical contaminants pesticide runoff
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_297.wav and when it works its way through the system
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_299.wav and leaves the water is cleaner than when it entered
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_301.wav the system is so healthy it purifies the water
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_303.wav so not just a farm that doesnt feed its animals not just a farm that measures its health
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_305.wav health success by the health of its predators
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_307.wav but a farm thats literally a water purification plant
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_309.wav and not just for those fish
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_311.wav but for you and me as well because when that water leaves it dumps out into the atlantic
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_313.wav a drop in the ocean i know but ill take it and so should you
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_315.wav because this love story
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_317.wav however romantic is also instructive
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_318.wav you might say its a recipe for the future of good food
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_320.wav whether were talking about bass or beef cattle
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_322.wav what we need now is a radically new conception of agriculture one in which the food actually tastes good
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_324.wav but for a lot people
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_325.wav thats a bit too radical
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_326.wav were not realists us foodies
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_327.wav were lovers
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_328.wav we love farmers markets we love small family farms
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_329.wav we talk about local food we eat organic
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_331.wav and when you suggest these are the things that will insure
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_332.wav the future of good food someone somewhere stands up and says hey guy
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_334.wav i love pink flamingos but how are you going to feed the world how are you going to feed the world
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_336.wav how are you going to feed the world can i be honest i dont love that question
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_338.wav no not because we already produce enough calories to more than feed the world
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_340.wav one billion people
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_342.wav will go hungry today one billion thats more than ever before
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_344.wav because of gross inequalities in distribution not tonnage
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_346.wav no i dont love this question because its determined the logic of our food system for the last fifty years
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_348.wav feed grain to herbivores
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_350.wav pesticides to monocultures chemicals to soil chicken to fish
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_352.wav and all along agribusiness has simply asked
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_354.wav if were feeding more people more cheaply how terrible could that be
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_356.wav thats been the motivation its been the justification its been the business plan
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_358.wav of american agriculture we should call it what it is
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_360.wav a business in liquidation
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_362.wav a business thats quickly eroding ecological capital that makes that very production possible
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_363.wav thats not a business and it isnt agriculture
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_364.wav our bread basket is threatened today not because of diminishing supply but because of diminishing resources
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_366.wav not by the latest combine and tractor invention but by fertile land
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_368.wav not by pumps but by fresh water
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_370.wav not by chainsaws but by forests and not by fishing boats and nets but by fish in the sea want to feed the world
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_372.wav lets start by asking how are we going to feed ourselves
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_374.wav or better how can we create conditions that enable every community
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_375.wav to feed itself
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_377.wav to do that dont look
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_378.wav at the agribusiness model for the future its really old and its tired its high on capital chemistry and machines
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_380.wav and its never produced anything really good to eat
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_382.wav instead lets look to the ecological model
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_384.wav thats the one that relies on two billion years
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_386.wav of on the job experience
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_388.wav farms that arent worlds unto themselves
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_389.wav farms that
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_390.wav restore instead of deplete farms that farm extensively instead of just intensively
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_392.wav farmers that are not just producers but experts in relationships
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_393.wav because theyre the ones
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_394.wav that are experts in flavor too
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_396.wav and if im going to be really honest
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_398.wav theyre a better chef than ill ever be
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_399.wav you know im okay with that
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/DanBarber_2010_400.wav because if thats the future of good food its going to be delicious thank you
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JamesCameron_2010_1.wav i grew up on a steady diet of science fiction in high school i i took a bus to school an hour each way every day and i was always absorbed in a book
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JamesCameron_2010_2.wav science fiction book which took my mind to other worlds and satisfied this in in a in a narrative form this insatiable sense of curiosity that i had and and
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JamesCameron_2010_3.wav you know that curiosity also manifested itself in in
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JamesCameron_2010_4.wav the fact that whenever i wasnt in school i was i was out in the woods hiking and taking
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JamesCameron_2010_5.wav samples frogs and snakes and bugs and pond water and bringing it back looking at it under the microscope i was you know i was a real science geek but it was all about trying to understand
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JamesCameron_2010_6.wav understand the world understand the the limits of of possibility and my you know love of of science fiction
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JamesCameron_2010_7.wav actually seemed to be mirrored in the world around me because what was happening this is in the late sixties
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JamesCameron_2010_8.wav you know we were we were going to the moon we were exploring the deep oceans jacques cousteau was coming into our living rooms with his amazing specials that showed us animals and places and a you know a wondrous world that we could never really have
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JamesCameron_2010_9.wav previously imagined so that seemed to resonate with the whole science fiction part of it
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JamesCameron_2010_10.wav and i was a an artist i could draw i could paint and and i i found that because there werent you know video games and this saturation of cg movies and and all of this imagery in the media landscape
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JamesCameron_2010_11.wav i had to create these images in my head you know we all did as kids having to read a book and through the authors description put something on on the screen the movie screen in our heads and so my
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JamesCameron_2010_12.wav response to this was to paint to draw alien creatures alien worlds robots spaceships all that stuff i was endlessly getting busted in math class you know doodling behind the behind the textbook and
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JamesCameron_2010_13.wav that was the creativity had to had to find its outlet somehow and an interesting thing happened the the jacques cousteau
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JamesCameron_2010_14.wav shows actually got me very excited about the fact that there was an alien world right here on earth i might not really go to an alien world on a spaceship someday that that seemed pretty pretty darn unlikely
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JamesCameron_2010_15.wav but i could that was a world i could really go to right here on earth that was as as rich and exotic as anything that i had imagined from reading these books
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JamesCameron_2010_16.wav so i decided i was going to become a scuba diver at the age of fifteen and the only problem with that was that i lived in a little village in canada six hundred miles from the nearest ocean
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JamesCameron_2010_17.wav but i didnt let that daunt me i pestered my father until he finally found a a scuba class in in buffalo new york right across the border from where we live
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JamesCameron_2010_18.wav and i actually got certified in a pool in a ymca in the dead of winter in buffalo new york and
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JamesCameron_2010_19.wav i didnt see the ocean a a real ocean for another two years until we until we moved to california you know since then you know in in the in the intervening
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JamesCameron_2010_20.wav forty years ive ive spent about three thousand hours underwater and five hundred hours of that was in submersibles and ive learned that
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JamesCameron_2010_21.wav that that deep ocean environment and even the shallow oceans are so rich with with amazing life
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JamesCameron_2010_22.wav that really is beyond beyond our imagination you know natures imagination is so
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JamesCameron_2010_23.wav so boundless compared to our own meager human imagination i still to this day stand in absolute awe of what i what i see when i make these dives and my love affair with the ocean is
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JamesCameron_2010_24.wav is ongoing and and just as strong as it ever was but when i when i chose a career as an adult
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JamesCameron_2010_25.wav it was film making and that seemed to be the best way to reconcile
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JamesCameron_2010_26.wav this urge i had to tell stories with my my urges to create images and i was as a kid constantly drawing comic books and so on so film making was the way to put put pictures and stories together and that made sense and of course the stories that
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JamesCameron_2010_27.wav i chose to tell were science fiction stories terminator aliens and the abyss and with the abyss i i was putting together my love of underwater and diving with film making so you know
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JamesCameron_2010_28.wav merging the two passions something interesting came out of the abyss which was
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JamesCameron_2010_29.wav that to solve a specific narrative problem on that film which was to create this kind of liquid water creature
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JamesCameron_2010_30.wav we actually embraced computer generated animation cg and
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JamesCameron_2010_31.wav this this resulted in the first soft surface character cg animation that was ever in a in a movie
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JamesCameron_2010_32.wav and even though the film didnt make any money barely broke even i should say i witnessed something amazing which is that the the audience the global audience was mesmerized by this apparent magic you know its arthur clarkes law that any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic they were seeing something magical
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JamesCameron_2010_33.wav and so that that that got me very excited and i thought wow this is this is something that needs to be embraced into the cinematic art so with terminator two which was my next film we took that much farther working with with ilm we created the liquid metal
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JamesCameron_2010_34.wav dude in that film the success hung in the balance on whether that effect would work and it did and we created magic again and we had the same result with an audience although we did make a little more money on that one so
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JamesCameron_2010_35.wav you know drawing a line through those those two two dots of of experience came to this this is going to be a whole new world this was a whole new world of creativity for
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JamesCameron_2010_36.wav for film artists so i i started a company with stan winston my good friend stan winston who is the the the premier make up and and creature designer
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JamesCameron_2010_37.wav at that time and it was called digital domain and the concept of the company was that we would leap frog past the kind of analog processes of of optical printers and so on and we would go right to digital production and we actually did that and it gave us a competitive advantage for a while
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JamesCameron_2010_38.wav but we found ourselves lagging in the in the mid nineties in the creature and character design stuff that we had actually founded the company to do
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JamesCameron_2010_39.wav so i wrote this piece called avatar which was meant to absolutely push the envelope
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JamesCameron_2010_40.wav of visual effects of cg effects beyond with realistic human emotive characters generated in cg and the main characters would all be in cg and the world would be in cg and
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JamesCameron_2010_41.wav you know the envelope pushed back and i was told by the folks at my company that we werent going to be able to do this for a while so i shelved it and i made this other movie about a big ship that sinks
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JamesCameron_2010_43.wav and you know i i went and pitched it to the studio as romeo and juliet on a ship its going to be this epic romance passionate
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JamesCameron_2010_44.wav film secretly what i wanted to do was i wanted to dive to the real wreck of titanic and thats why i made the movie
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JamesCameron_2010_46.wav and thats the truth now the studio didnt know that but i convinced them i said i said were going to dive to the wreck were going to film it for real well be using it in the opening of the film it will be really important it will be a great marketing hook and i talked them into funding an expedition
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JamesCameron_2010_48.wav sounds crazy but this goes back to that theme about you know your imagination creating a reality because we actually created a reality where six months later i find myself in a russian submersible
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JamesCameron_2010_49.wav two and a half miles down in the north atlantic looking at the real titanic through through a view port not a movie not hd for real
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JamesCameron_2010_51.wav now that that blew my mind and you know it took a lot of preparation we had to build cameras and lights and all kinds of things but it struck me how much this
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JamesCameron_2010_52.wav dive these deep dives was like a like a space mission you know where it was it was highly technical and it required enormous planning you get in this capsule you go down to this dark hostile environment where there is no hope of rescue if you cant get back by yourself
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JamesCameron_2010_53.wav and you know i i thought wow im im like living in a science fiction movie this is really cool
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JamesCameron_2010_54.wav and so i i really got bitten by the bug of deep ocean exploration of course the curiosity the science component of it it was everything it was adventure it was curiosity it was imagination and it was an experience
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JamesCameron_2010_55.wav that hollywood couldnt give me because you know i could imagine a creature and we could create a visual effect for it but i couldnt imagine what i was seeing out that window as we did some of our subsequent expeditions
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JamesCameron_2010_56.wav i was seeing creatures at hydrothermal vents and and sometimes things that i had had never seen before sometimes things that no one had seen before that actually were not described by science at the time that we saw them and imaged them so i was completely smitten by this
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JamesCameron_2010_57.wav and had to do more and so i actually made a kind of curious decision after the success of titanic i said okay you know im going to park my day job as a hollywood movie maker and im going to go be a full time explorer for a while
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JamesCameron_2010_58.wav and so you know we started planning these these expeditions and we wound up going to the bismark and and exploring it with with robotic vehicles we went back to the titanic wreck we took little bots that we had created that spooled a fiber optic
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JamesCameron_2010_59.wav and the idea was to go in and do an interior survey of that ship which had never been done nobody had ever looked inside the wreck they didnt have the means to do it so we created technology to do it
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JamesCameron_2010_60.wav so you know here i am now on the deck of titanic sitting in a submersible and looking out at planks that look much like this where i knew that the that the band had played
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JamesCameron_2010_61.wav and im flying a little robotic vehicle through the through the corridor of the of the ship you know when i say you know im im im operating it but my mind is in the vehicle
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JamesCameron_2010_62.wav i felt like i was physically present inside the shipwreck of titanic and it was the most surreal kind of deja vu experience ive ive ever had because
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JamesCameron_2010_63.wav i would know before i turned a corner what was going to be there before the lights of the vehicle actually revealed it because i had walked the set for months when we were making the movie
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JamesCameron_2010_64.wav and the set was based as an exact replica on the blueprints of the ship so it was this absolutely remarkable experience and it really made me realize that
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JamesCameron_2010_65.wav made me realize that the the telepresense experience that you actually can have these robotic avatars then your consciousness
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JamesCameron_2010_66.wav is is in injected into the into the vehicle into this this other form of existence it was really really quite profound and maybe a little bit of a glimpse to to what might be happening you know some decades out as
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JamesCameron_2010_67.wav as we start to have cyborg bodies for exploration or for other means in in many sort of post human futures that i that i can imagine as a science fiction fan so having done these these
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JamesCameron_2010_68.wav expeditions and and you know really beginning to appreciate what was down there such as at the at the the deep ocean vents where we had these
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JamesCameron_2010_69.wav amazing amazing animals they are basically aliens right here on earth they live in an environment of chemosynthesis they dont survive
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JamesCameron_2010_70.wav on sunlight based system the way we do and so youre seeing animals that are living next to a five hundred degree centigrade water plumes that you think they cant possibly exist at the same time
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JamesCameron_2010_72.wav i was getting very interested in space science as well again you know its the science fiction influence as a kid
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JamesCameron_2010_73.wav and i wound up getting involved with the space community really involved with with nasa sitting on the nasa advisory board planning actual space missions going to russia going to the pre cosmonaut biomedical protocols and all these sorts of things
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JamesCameron_2010_74.wav to actually go and fly to the international space station with our three d camera systems and this was fascinating but what what i wound up doing was bringing space scientists with us into the deep
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JamesCameron_2010_75.wav and taking them down so that they had access astrobiologists planetary scientists people who were interested in these extremely fine environments
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JamesCameron_2010_76.wav taking them down to the vents and letting them see and take samples and test instruments and so on so here we were making documentary films but actually doing science and actually doing space science
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JamesCameron_2010_77.wav id completely closed the loop between being the science fiction fan you know as a kid and doing this stuff for real
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JamesCameron_2010_78.wav and you know along the way in this journey of discovery i learned a lot i learned a lot about science but i also learned a lot about
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JamesCameron_2010_79.wav leadership now you think directors got to be a leader leader of you know captain of the ship and all that sort of thing i didnt really learn about leadership until
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JamesCameron_2010_81.wav i did these expeditions because i had to at a certain point say what am i doing out here why am i doing this what do i get out of it
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JamesCameron_2010_82.wav we dont make money at these damn shows you know we barely break even there is no fame in it people sort of think i went away between titanic and avatar and was buffing my nails someplace you know sitting at the beach made all these films made all these documentary films you know for a very
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JamesCameron_2010_83.wav limited audience no fame no glory no money what are you doing youre doing it for the task itself for the challenge
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JamesCameron_2010_84.wav and the ocean is the most challenging environment there is for the thrill of discovery and for that strange bond that happens
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JamesCameron_2010_85.wav when a small group of people form a tightly knit team because we would do these things with ten twelve people working for years at a time
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JamesCameron_2010_86.wav sometimes at sea for for for two or three months at a time and in that bond you realize that the most important thing
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JamesCameron_2010_87.wav is the respect that you have for them and that they have for you that youve done a task
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JamesCameron_2010_88.wav that you cant explain to someone else when you come back to the shore and you say you know we had to do this and the fiber optic and the attentuation and the this and the that all the all the technology of it and the difficulty the human performance aspects of working at sea
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JamesCameron_2010_89.wav you cant explain it to people its that thing that that maybe cops have or people in in combat that have gone through something together and they know they can never explain it creates a bond creates a bond of respect so when i came back to make my next movie which was avatar
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JamesCameron_2010_90.wav i tried to apply that same principle of leadership which is that you respect your team and you earn their respect in return and it really changed the dynamic so here i was again with a small team
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JamesCameron_2010_91.wav in you know in uncharted territory doing avatar coming up with new technology that didnt exist before tremendously exciting tremendously challenging and we became a family
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JamesCameron_2010_92.wav over a four and half year period and it completely changed how i do movies so people have commented on how well you know you brought back the ocean organisms and put them on the planet of pandora to me it was more of a fundamental way of doing business the process itself that changed as a result of that
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JamesCameron_2010_93.wav so what can we synthesize out of all this you know whats the what are the lessons learned well i think number one is curiosity its the most powerful thing you own imagination
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JamesCameron_2010_94.wav is a force that can actually manifest a reality and the respect of your team is more important than all the laurels in the world
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JamesCameron_2010_96.wav i have young film makers
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JamesCameron_2010_97.wav come up to me and say you know give me some advice for doing this
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JamesCameron_2010_98.wav and i say
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JamesCameron_2010_99.wav dont put limitations on yourself other people will do that for you dont do it to yourself dont bet against yourself and and take risks nasa has this has this phrase that they like failure is not an option
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JamesCameron_2010_100.wav but failure has to be an option in art and in exploration because its a leap of faith and no important endeavor that required innovation
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JamesCameron_2010_101.wav was done without risk you have to be willing to take those risks so thats the thought i would leave you with is that in whatever youre doing failure
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/JamesCameron_2010_102.wav is an option but fear is not thank
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/MichaelSpecter_2010_1.wav lets pretend right here we have a machine a big machine a cool ted ish machine and its a time machine and everyone in this room has to get into it and you can go backwards you can go forwards you cannot stay where you are
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/MichaelSpecter_2010_2.wav and i wonder what youd choose because ive been asking my friends this question a lot lately and they all want to go back i dont know they want to go back before there were automobiles or twitter or american idol
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/MichaelSpecter_2010_3.wav i dont know im im convinced that theres some sort of pull to nostalgia to wishful thinking and i understand that im not part of that crowd i have to say
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/MichaelSpecter_2010_4.wav i dont want to go back and its not because im adventurous its because possibilities on this planet they dont go back they go forward so i want to get in the machine and i want to go forward
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/MichaelSpecter_2010_5.wav this is the greatest time theres ever been on this planet by any measure you wish to choose health wealth
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/MichaelSpecter_2010_6.wav mobility opportunity declining rates of disease theres never been a time like this my great grandparents
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/MichaelSpecter_2010_7.wav died all of them by the time they were sixty my grandparents pushed that number to seventy my parents are closing in on eighty so ive
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/MichaelSpecter_2010_8.wav thered better be thered better be a nine at the beginning of my death number but its not even about people like us because
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/MichaelSpecter_2010_9.wav this is a bigger deal than that a kid born in new delhi today can expect to live as long as the richest man in the world did one hundred years ago
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/MichaelSpecter_2010_10.wav think about that its an incredible fact and why is it true
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/MichaelSpecter_2010_11.wav smallpox smallpox killed billions of people on this planet it reshaped the demography of the globe in a way that no war ever has its gone
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/MichaelSpecter_2010_12.wav its vanished we vanquished it puff in the rich world
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/MichaelSpecter_2010_13.wav diseases that threatened millions of us just a generation ago no longer exist hardly diphtheria rubella polio does anyone even know what those things are
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/MichaelSpecter_2010_15.wav vaccines modern medicine our ability to feed billions of people those are triumphs of the scientific method and to my mind the scientific method trying stuff out
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/MichaelSpecter_2010_17.wav seeing if it works changing it when it doesnt is one of the great accomplishments of humanity so thats the good news
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/MichaelSpecter_2010_18.wav unfortunately thats all the good news because theres some other problems and theyve been mentioned many times and one of them is that
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/MichaelSpecter_2010_19.wav despite all our accomplishments a billion people go to bed hungry in this world
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/MichaelSpecter_2010_20.wav every day that numbers rising and its rising really rapidly and its disgraceful and not only that weve used our imagination
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/MichaelSpecter_2010_21.wav to thoroughly trash this globe potable water arable land rainforest oil gas theyre going away
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/MichaelSpecter_2010_22.wav and theyre going away soon and unless we innovate our way out of this mess were going away too
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/MichaelSpecter_2010_23.wav so the question is can we do that and i i think we can i think its clear that we can make food that will feed billions of people without raping the land that they live on i think we can power this world with energy that doesnt also destroy it
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/MichaelSpecter_2010_24.wav i really do believe that and no it aint wishful thinking but heres the thing that keeps me up at night one of the things that keeps me up at night
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/MichaelSpecter_2010_26.wav weve never needed progress in science more than we need it right now never and weve also never been in a position to deploy it properly in the way that we can today were on the verge of amazing amazing events in many fields
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/MichaelSpecter_2010_27.wav and yet i actually think wed have to go back hundreds three hundred years before the enlightenment to find a time when we battled progress when we fought about these things more vigorously on on more fronts
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/MichaelSpecter_2010_28.wav than we do now people wrap themselves in their beliefs and they do it so tightly that you cant set them free not even the truth will set them free and listen
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/MichaelSpecter_2010_29.wav everyones entitled to their opinion theyre even entitled to their opinion about progress but you know what youre not entitled to youre not entitled to your own facts sorry youre not and this took me awhile to figure out
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/MichaelSpecter_2010_30.wav about a decade ago i wrote a story about vaccines for the new yorker a little story and i was amazed to find opposition opposition to what is after all the most effective public health measure in human history
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/MichaelSpecter_2010_32.wav i didnt know what to do so i just did what i do i wrote a story and i moved on and soon after that
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/MichaelSpecter_2010_34.wav i wrote a story about genetically engineered food same thing only bigger people were going crazy so
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/MichaelSpecter_2010_35.wav i wrote a story about that too and i couldnt understand why people thought this was frankenfoods why they thought moving molecules around in a specific rather than a haphazard way was trespassing on natures ground
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/MichaelSpecter_2010_36.wav but you know i do what i do i wrote the story i moved on i mean im a journalist
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/MichaelSpecter_2010_37.wav we type we file we go to dinner its fine
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/MichaelSpecter_2010_39.wav but these stories bothered me and i couldnt figure out why and eventually i did and thats because those fanatics that were driving me crazy werent actually fanatics at all they were thoughtful people educated people decent people
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/MichaelSpecter_2010_40.wav they were exactly like the people in this room
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/MichaelSpecter_2010_41.wav and it it just disturbed me so much but then i thought you know lets be honest were at a point in this world
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/MichaelSpecter_2010_42.wav where we dont have the same relationship to progress that we used to we talk about it ambivalently we talk about it in ironic terms with little quotes around it progress
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/MichaelSpecter_2010_44.wav okay there are reasons for that and i think we know what those reasons are weve lost faith in institutions in authority and sometimes in science itself and there theres no reason we shouldnt have you can just say a few names and people will understand
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/MichaelSpecter_2010_45.wav chernobyl bhopal the challenger
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/MichaelSpecter_2010_46.wav vioxx weapons of mass destruction hanging chads
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/MichaelSpecter_2010_47.wav i mean you know you can choose your list
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/MichaelSpecter_2010_48.wav there are questions and problems with the people we used to believe were always right so be skeptical
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/MichaelSpecter_2010_50.wav ask questions demand proof demand evidence dont take anything for granted but heres the thing when you get proof
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/MichaelSpecter_2010_51.wav you need to accept the proof and were not that good at doing that
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/MichaelSpecter_2010_52.wav and the reason that i can say that is because were now in an epidemic of fear like one ive never seen and hope never to see again about twelve years ago there was a story published a horrible story
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/MichaelSpecter_2010_53.wav that linked the epidemic of autism to the measles mumps and rubella vaccine shot
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/MichaelSpecter_2010_55.wav very scary tons of studies were done to see if this was true tons of studies should have been done its a serious issue
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/MichaelSpecter_2010_57.wav the data came back the data came back from the united states from england from sweden from canada and it was all the same no correlation no connection none at all
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/MichaelSpecter_2010_58.wav it doesnt matter it doesnt matter because we believe anecdotes we believe what we see what we think we see what makes us feel real
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/MichaelSpecter_2010_59.wav we dont believe a bunch of documents from a government official giving us data and i i do understand that i think we all do but you know what
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/MichaelSpecter_2010_60.wav the result of that has been disastrous disastrous because heres a fact
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/MichaelSpecter_2010_61.wav the united states is one of the only countries in the world where the vaccine rate for measles is going down
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/MichaelSpecter_2010_62.wav that is disgraceful and we should be ashamed of ourselves its horrible
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/MichaelSpecter_2010_63.wav and what kind what kind of a thing happened that we could do that now
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/MichaelSpecter_2010_64.wav i understand it i do understand it because does anyone have measles here has one person in this audience ever see someone die of measles
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/MichaelSpecter_2010_65.wav doesnt happen very much doesnt happen in this country at all but it happened a hundred and sixty thousand times in the world last year thats a lot of death of measles twenty an hour
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/MichaelSpecter_2010_67.wav but since it didnt happen here we can put it out of our minds and people like jenny mccarthy
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/MichaelSpecter_2010_68.wav can go around preaching messages of fear and illiteracy from platforms like oprah and larry king live
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/MichaelSpecter_2010_69.wav and they can do it because they dont link causation and correlation they dont understand that these things seem the same but theyre almost never the same and its something we need to learn and we need to learn it really soon
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/MichaelSpecter_2010_71.wav this guy was a hero jonas salk he took one of the worst scourges of mankind away from us no fear no agony polio puff gone
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/MichaelSpecter_2010_72.wav that guy in the middle not so much his name is paul offit
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/MichaelSpecter_2010_73.wav he just developed a rotavirus vaccine with a bunch of other people its save the lives of four hundred five hundred thousand
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/MichaelSpecter_2010_74.wav kids in the developing world every year pretty good right well its good except that paul goes around talking about vaccines and says how valuable they are and that people ought to just stop the whining and he actually says it that way so pauls a terrorist
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/MichaelSpecter_2010_75.wav when paul speaks in a public hearing he cant testify without armed guards he gets called at home because people like to tell him that they remember where his kids go to school
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/MichaelSpecter_2010_76.wav and why because paul made a vaccine i dont need to say this but vaccines are essential you take them away disease comes back horrible diseases and thats happening we have measles in this country now
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/MichaelSpecter_2010_77.wav and its getting worse and pretty soon kids are going to die again because its just a numbers game and theyre not just going to die of measles what about polio lets have that
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/MichaelSpecter_2010_78.wav why not a college classmate of mine wrote me a couple weeks ago and said you know she thought i was a little strident no ones ever said that before
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/MichaelSpecter_2010_79.wav she wasnt going to vaccinate her kid against polio no way fine
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/MichaelSpecter_2010_80.wav why because we dont have polio and you know what we didnt have polio in this country yesterday today i dont know maybe a guy got on a plane in lagos this morning and hes flying to lax right now hes over ohio
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/MichaelSpecter_2010_81.wav and hes going to land in a couple hours hes going to rent a car and hes going to come to long beach and hes going to attend one of these fabulous ted dinners tonight and he doesnt know that hes infected with a paralytic disease and we dont either because thats the way the world works thats the planet we live on
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/MichaelSpecter_2010_82.wav dont pretend it isnt now we love to wrap ourselves in lies we love to do it everyone take their vitamins this morning
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/MichaelSpecter_2010_83.wav echinacea echinacea a little antioxidant to get you going
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/MichaelSpecter_2010_84.wav i know you did because half of americans do every day they take the stuff and they take alternative medicines and it doesnt matter how often we
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/MichaelSpecter_2010_85.wav find out that theyre useless the data says it all the time they darken your urine they almost never do more than that
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/MichaelSpecter_2010_87.wav its okay you want to pay twenty eight billion dollars for dark urine im totally with you
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/MichaelSpecter_2010_89.wav dark urine dark
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/MichaelSpecter_2010_91.wav why do we do that why do we do that well i think i understand we hate big pharma we hate big government we dont trust the man and we shouldnt our health care system sucks
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/MichaelSpecter_2010_92.wav its cruel to millions of people its absolutely astonishingly cold
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/MichaelSpecter_2010_93.wav and soul bending to those of us who can even afford it so we run away from it and where do we run we leap into the arms of big placebo
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/MichaelSpecter_2010_95.wav thats fantastic i love big placebo
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/MichaelSpecter_2010_97.wav but you know its not its its its really a serious thing because this stuff is crap and we spend billions of dollars on it and i have all sorts of little props here
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/MichaelSpecter_2010_98.wav none of it ginkgo fraud
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/MichaelSpecter_2010_99.wav echinacea fraud acai i dont even know what that is but were spending billions of dollars on it its fraud
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/MichaelSpecter_2010_100.wav and you know what when i say this stuff people scream at me and they say what do you care let people do what they want to do its its it makes them feel good and you know what youre wrong because
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/MichaelSpecter_2010_101.wav i dont care if its the secretary of h h s
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/MichaelSpecter_2010_102.wav whos saying hmm im not going to take the evidence of my experts on the mammograms or some cancer quack who wants to treat his patient

tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/MichaelSpecter_2010_105.wav that beetroot garlic and lemon oil were much more effective than the antiretroviral drugs we know can slow the course of aids hundreds of thousands of needless deaths in a country that has been plagued worse than any other by this disease
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/MichaelSpecter_2010_106.wav please dont tell me there are no consequences to these things there are there always are now
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/MichaelSpecter_2010_107.wav the most mindless epidemic were in the middle of right now is this absurd battle between
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/MichaelSpecter_2010_108.wav proponents of genetically engineered food and the organic elite its an idiotic debate it has to stop its a debate about words about metaphors
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/MichaelSpecter_2010_109.wav its ideology its not science
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/MichaelSpecter_2010_110.wav every single thing we eat every grain of rice every sprig of parsley every brussel sprout has been modified by man you know there werent tangerines in the garden of eden
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/MichaelSpecter_2010_111.wav there wasnt any cantaloupe
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/MichaelSpecter_2010_112.wav there werent christmas trees we made it all we made it over the last eleven thousand years
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/MichaelSpecter_2010_114.wav and some of it worked and some of it didnt we got rid of the stuff that didnt now we can do it in a more precise way and there are risks
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/MichaelSpecter_2010_115.wav absolutely but we can put something like vitamin a into rice and that stuff can help millions of people millions of people prolong their lives
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/MichaelSpecter_2010_117.wav you dont want to do that i i have to say i dont understand it we object to genetically engineered food why do we do that well the things i constantly hear are
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/MichaelSpecter_2010_118.wav too many chemicals pesticides hormones
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/MichaelSpecter_2010_119.wav monoculture we dont want giant fields of the same thing thats wrong
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/MichaelSpecter_2010_120.wav we dont want companies patenting life we dont want companies owning seeds and you know what my response to all of that is yes
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/MichaelSpecter_2010_121.wav youre right lets fix it its true weve got a huge food problem but this isnt science
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/MichaelSpecter_2010_122.wav this has nothing to do with science its law its morality its patent stuff you know science isnt a company its not a country
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/MichaelSpecter_2010_123.wav its not even an idea its a process
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/MichaelSpecter_2010_124.wav its a process and sometimes it works and sometimes it doesnt but the idea that we should not allow science to do its job because were afraid
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/MichaelSpecter_2010_125.wav is really very deadening and its preventing millions of people from prospering you know in the next
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/MichaelSpecter_2010_126.wav fifty years were going to have to grow seventy percent more food than we do right now seventy percent this is investment in africa over the last thirty years disgraceful disgraceful they need it and were not giving it to them and why
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/MichaelSpecter_2010_127.wav genetically engineered food we dont want to encourage people to eat that rotten stuff like cassava for instance cassavas something that half a billion people eat its kind of like a potato its just a bunch of calories it sucks
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/MichaelSpecter_2010_128.wav it doesnt have nutrients it doesnt have protein and scientists are engineering all of that into it right now
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/MichaelSpecter_2010_129.wav and then people would be able to eat it and theyd be able to not go blind they wouldnt starve and you know what that would be nice it wouldnt be chez panisse but it would be nice
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/MichaelSpecter_2010_131.wav and all i can say about this is
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/MichaelSpecter_2010_132.wav why are we fighting it why i mean lets ask ourselves why are we fighting it because we dont want to move genes around this is about moving genes around its not about chemicals
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/MichaelSpecter_2010_133.wav its not about our ridiculous passion for hormones our insistence on having bigger food better food singular food
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/MichaelSpecter_2010_134.wav this isnt about rice krispies this is about keeping people alive and its about time we started to understand what that meant because you know something if we dont
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/MichaelSpecter_2010_135.wav if we continue to act the way were acting were guilty of something that i dont think we want to be guilty of high tech colonialism theres no other way to describe whats going on here its selfish
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/MichaelSpecter_2010_136.wav its ugly its beneath us and we really have to stop it
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/MichaelSpecter_2010_138.wav so after this amazingly fun conversation
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/MichaelSpecter_2010_140.wav you might want to say so you still want to get in this ridiculous time machine and go forward
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/MichaelSpecter_2010_141.wav and absolutely absolutely i do its stuck in the present right now but we have an amazing opportunity we can set that time machine on anything we want we can move it where we want to move it
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/MichaelSpecter_2010_142.wav and were going to move it where we want to move it we have to have these conversations and we have to think but when we get in the time machine and we go ahead
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/MichaelSpecter_2010_143.wav were going to be happy we do i know that we can and as far as im concerned
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/MichaelSpecter_2010_144.wav thats something the world needs right now thank you
tedlium/TEDLIUM_release2/test/sph/MichaelSpecter_2010_146.wav thank you
