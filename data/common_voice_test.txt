common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000082.wav he could always go back to being a shepherd

common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000060.wav the boy reminded the old man that he had said something about hidden treasure
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000117.wav then he sat in the sunfilled doorway smoking the hookah
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000135.wav sometimes i get so mad at you i cant see straight

common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000185.wav one is loved because one is loved
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000035.wav henderson stood up with a spade in his hand

common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000191.wav apparently its the dumplings that make this stew taste so good
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000095.wav he remembered something his grandfather had once told him that butterflies were a good omen
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000081.wav its candice now on long distance from washington
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000181.wav my tax dollars pay for those public school proms
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000052.wav he did find it soon after dawn and not far from the sand pits
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000182.wav just give me a few hours before you make any decisions
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000210.wav and their eyes spoke of death
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000003.wav down below in the darkness were hundreds of people sleeping in peace
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000168.wav dont give in to your fears said the alchemist in a strangely gentle voice
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000248.wav then where is your gun
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000217.wav in spite of this i still believed that there were men in mars
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000149.wav make sure youve read my introductory post on voice coding since we will be building upon that

common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000244.wav jupiter has a great red spot
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000239.wav it was such a gradual movement that he found it only by noticing the dots
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000214.wav i would have won the junior olympics if not for those medaling kids
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000285.wav no one seemed to have thought about it that night
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000286.wav the man was speaking the language of alchemy
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000297.wav from then on he would make his own decisions
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000230.wav but his heart was speaking of other things
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000227.wav at most they thought that another meteorite had descended
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000245.wav then you taught me something of the universal language and the soul of the world
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000223.wav i noticed that the boy answered
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000289.wav i found a little crowd of about twenty people surrounding the huge hole
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000301.wav i should thank you
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000288.wav a drought hit western europe
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000249.wav and one can always come back
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000184.wav in one he had read that many years ago a famous arabian alchemist had visited europe
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000304.wav the stranger placed his sword in its scabbard and the boy relaxed
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000221.wav sadly my dream of becoming a squirrel whisperer may never happen
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000294.wav he was able to get on his knees but he quickly slipped back
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000321.wav some went away while i was there and other people came
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000270.wav the boy remembered an old proverb from his country
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000328.wav now the moons out

common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000341.wav that sobered him a little
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000281.wav and the sand and gravel had been flung violently in every direction
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000257.wav i have already described the appearance of that colossal bulk which was embedded in the ground
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000330.wav but ill make you and maria a business proposition
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000314.wav this is what was written on the emerald tablet said the alchemist when he had finished
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000368.wav he was sure the girl would never understand
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000349.wav there was no need to imprison them the arabs simply confiscated their horses
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000352.wav that night there was another jetting out of gas from the distant planet
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000365.wav they were on the right track
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000372.wav he started to read the book he had bought
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000381.wav this is for you he said holding one of the parts out to the monk
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000347.wav the boy looked around for the ovens and other apparatus used in alchemy but saw none
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000211.wav the alchemist is two hundred years old the englishman had told him
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000344.wav theyre not my sheep anymore he said to himself without nostalgia

common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000398.wav where was his horse
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000342.wav and there were dunes rocks and plants that insisted on living where survival seemed impossible
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000406.wav it was the pure language of the world
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000356.wav before the sun had reached its high point five hundred tribesmen appeared on the horizon
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000414.wav i myself heard nothing of that

common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000426.wav i get more of a kick out of it that way

common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000370.wav the thought was so dreadful to him that he forgot about the heat and went forward
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000465.wav i should have been there
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000467.wav this is the first phase of the job he said
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000446.wav and in that way the months passed
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000471.wav this is christmas eve
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000470.wav you certainly delivered the goods

common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000476.wav i thought about whether we should find coins and models in it and so on
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000438.wav i could have helped her
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000484.wav well have something to drink and eat these hawks

common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000459.wav it was however still so hot from its flight through the air
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000487.wav until then he had considered the omens to be things of this world
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000516.wav i want to tell you a story about dreams said the alchemist
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000376.wav maybe she didnt even remember him
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000403.wav everyone on earth has a treasure that awaits him his heart said

common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000514.wav hell be ready on time
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000421.wav it seemed as if what the old king had called beginners luck were no longer functioning
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000545.wav what do you mean by that
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000531.wav she placed the glass carefully on the edge of the table
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000504.wav she used her microscope to inspect it
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000397.wav everyone when they are young knows what their destiny is
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000553.wav you got someplace to sleep

common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000499.wav its going to take a while the boy said
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000493.wav then he realized that he had been distracted for a few moments looking at the sword
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000549.wav its a private club for only the most respectable people
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000566.wav do not do tomorrow what you could do today
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000579.wav what have you got to report
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000513.wav the stranger seemed satisfied with the answer
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000411.wav whenever he saw the sea or a fire he fell silent impressed by their elemental force
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000585.wav even if you cleaned my crystal for an entire year
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000596.wav how could you even think that
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000530.wav my wife pointed out to me the brightness of the red green and yellow signal lights
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000569.wav the boy spent a sleepless night
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000573.wav is this the ear you cant hear on
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000592.wav he didnt want any conversation at this point
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000538.wav they were looking only for gold his companion answered
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000532.wav because you will never again be able to keep it quiet
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000528.wav he instead offers an alternate explanation that relates to site scalability issues
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000618.wav amys a genius at research
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000550.wav we migrated our stuff from mac os to linux

common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000593.wav he had tried in vain to establish a relationship with an alchemist
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000605.wav this is unfair
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000611.wav most meteorites are more or less rounded
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000613.wav once to the thief and once to the general
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000641.wav i thought about the difficulties in translation that might arise
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000607.wav i had the everyone has gary buseys teeth dream again
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000617.wav but the boy was too frightened to listen to words of wisdom

common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000647.wav two more months passed and the shelf brought many customers into the crystal shop
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000633.wav thats the man who knows all the secrets of the world she said
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000632.wav the wind began to pick up
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000643.wav so now i fear nothing because it was those omens that brought you to me
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000672.wav how do people celebrate good weather over there
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000609.wav but id like to see the castles in the towns where they live the boy explained
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000629.wav he heard a muffled grating sound and saw the black mark jerk forward an inch or so
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000708.wav two horsemen waiting ahead of them
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000646.wav he had always believed that the sheep were able to understand what he said
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000651.wav it was however still so hot from its flight through the air
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000669.wav it may be the gases of the firing that caused the martians inconvenience
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000727.wav almost everyone here speaks spanish
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000663.wav and at that i told him and he took my place

common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000735.wav put jackie right on the staff
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000709.wav but you know that im not going to go to mecca
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000714.wav now i too will be one of the women who wait
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000687.wav it looked like a rusty gas float
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000698.wav he could sell the stones and buy a return ticket
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000684.wav i thought the unscrewing might be automatic
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000711.wav the article should discuss possible approaches to image registration
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000655.wav after all what he had always wanted was just that to know new places
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000728.wav the thing itself was almost entirely buried in sand
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000697.wav my seven year resume gap is marked not drugs
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000631.wav he became friendly with the camel driver who traveled alongside him
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000745.wav why didnt you tell me
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000679.wav hundreds of observers saw the flame that night and the night after
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000673.wav there was a thud like the fall of a great mass
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000724.wav all i saw was an army said the boy
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000755.wav the alchemist turned to the boy
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000702.wav he thought of the merchants daughter and was sure that she had probably married
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000705.wav today i understand something i didnt see before every blessing ignored becomes a curse
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000772.wav you cant do that
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000732.wav advancing slowly they searched among the stones
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000775.wav most meteorites are more or less rounded
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000753.wav but the boy never took his eye off his new friend
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000758.wav thats an inherent disadvantage
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000764.wav a practice of infidels he said to himself
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000752.wav they worked from early morning till late evening
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000725.wav the boy fell to the sand nearly unconscious
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000795.wav i have never seen a rothschild before
common_voice/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-test/sample-000799.wav it was just that he couldnt grasp what it meant
